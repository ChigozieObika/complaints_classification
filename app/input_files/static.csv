Comcast Internet,42162,Charleston,South Carolina,48230,"Our house has not one but two comcast internet boxes and both deliver less than average quality. Probably about 10 times a day, the internet box will kick off devices for absolutely no reason. This has been happening since November 2014. Basically when we are in the middle of browsing or streaming, the internet will stop working and according to the computer, I am connected to the network but have no internet connection. I then have to disconnect and reconnect. Once in a while, it won't even let me reconnect. I have had comcast come out to our house twice and tried to explain our issues but somehow the geniuses over at comcast can't understand the problem or the magnifying frustration that it causes. The Comcast tech guys tell me they see no problem and that it must be my computer. But this problem on happens with the comcast box internet, not any other network I try and conncet to. Furthermore, it happens to every device in our house including ipads, iphones, macs, and windows computers. Why is it so difficult for comcast to provide internet that is good quality. Also, when we moved into our apartment in August, it took comcast 17 days to finally come out and set up our internet even though I called a month in advance and they assured me that I could set it up my self despite the house never been wired for comcast before. I honestly think we need a new internet box and I tried to telling comcast that but they didn't listen to me. If I could switch to a different provider I would.

Comcast slamming/overcharge/,42121,Happy Valley,Oregon,97086,"I recently moved and had comcast transfer services to our new address. Once into the new house the tech support team could not get the internet/TV working one offered to have a tech come out and get everything set up for us and also credit our account 134.93. On the day that the tech came out our account was at a zero balance as they promised but them the charges were added to a ""new account"" that they set up for us the next month. There were undisclosed charges ($70.00) to my account for the tech coming out to our house to fix the problem they couldn't fix over both chat and phone. Plus then I was charged $100 (while the tech was at my house) for what they said was a deposit for services. I later learned was an upgrade service fee that was also undisclosed. A deposit would be refundable while a upgrade fee would not be considered refundable. (Why do I have to pay to upgrade my service and also a monthly service fee plus rental/lease for their modems/routers and DVR boxes?)
 Upon receiving my bill after moving I expected the billed amount to be around $145.00 but the new statement read 328.73 + the 134.93 that had been credited to my account prior for poor support and it was due immediately. There is also slamming charges to the account for a speed increase for internet that I did not order in the amount of $46.00 plus 37.09 for a partial month amount for this service as well. I called in and spent time in the billing department when that had no resolve I asked to be escalated to a supervisor which had also no effect in correcting the issue so I threatened to cancel my service which directed me to be transferred the loyalty (save) team for comcast customers. This is where I have spent many hours over the last 3 weeks trying to settle the difference of my account. I have been threatened, yelled at, verbally abused and harassed to pay this amount that they have slammed me for and have yet had no resolve. In fact they have gone as far as to disconnect my service twice and also reinstate it after many hours of arguing and raging complaints against their collections department employees. I have more knowledge of the calling tree and comcasts inner working departments than one non-comcast employee/customer would like to have. I have spent hours upon hours trying to get a bill fixed with handfuls of operator ID numbers, voice mails left for handfuls of supervisors and nothing shows resolve or even promise of resolve. I am fearful that they will send me to collections and hurt my credit rating if I cancel their service without payment but am not sure where else to turn or what else to do other than pay the as of today and the new billing cycle 682.65 dollars. ( new billing cycle came out last night, ugh) for what should be a $143.04 bill.

Comcast Very Bad /Rude customer service,42116,Johns Creek,Georgia,30097,"I am having comcast internet service in Johns creek GA. They charged me $161 for last month (Just internet service). This includes $39.99 service charge for technician to come and he didn't do anything inside. They were not supposed to charge.
 I have no other internet provider here and I am stuck with very bad customer service ( I don't expect this kind of service in USA). Even when i called for the service, CSR/Supervisor hung up his phone on me. Monopoly of Comcast internet service should go away , otherwise customers will suffer.

 According to what I have read in the paper and on line, Comcast/Xfinity will be issuing their customers a $5.00 credit for the days loss of telephone and internet, which doesn't seem enough for all the missed calls and emails. They have never before authorized a credit for any other time we were without service. We will have to wait and see if this truly happens. Thank you for your response.

Comcast bundling of internet and tv services and deceptive sales practices??,42184,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,15224,"I moved to a new house in Pittsburgh, PA 1 week ago and called a local comcast sales representative to set up internet service. I was told that the price for 105 Mbps (down)/ 25 Mbps (up) would be $59.99. The salesman then informed me that for an additional $5 per month, I would be able to get 80 channels in SD and stream those same channels in HD on my computer. I was told that I was not under any contracts and that I could drop the cable channels and streaming to return to the original $59.99 internet only plan. After trying and failing to get the streaming services to work satisfactorily, I attempted to cancel the cable channels and streaming and keep the internet only for $59.99. I was then told that cancelling the streaming would cause my bill to INCREASE to $78.99. The way in which the services are bundled forces the consumer to pay more money for less services and are artificially inflating my bill. Additional fees, including taxes on TV ($4.77) and ""Broadcast TV fee"" ($3.25) are also present on the bill, such that the true price of the cable addon is $5 + $3.25 + 4.77 = $13.02. These additional fees were not disclosed at the time of purchase. The practices used by comcast are deceptive and unfair. Comcast has not been helpful in resolving this issue.

Comcast Customer Service,42177,Aliquippa,Pennsylvania,15001,"We are trying to get an itemization of our Bill from Comcast / Xfinity. My husband is a disabled veteran and is going back to school so that he might be able to have a Career that will sustain for the rest of his years until he is at retirement age. Because of the help from the VA department he can be reimbursed for the portion of the bill that we pay for the internet. We have been trying to get an itemization so that we can submit it for reimbursement. Little did we know that this would end up being one of the hardest things to do? I have called last month and try to get the answer in writing. The Customer Service department told me that they could not do that, they told me that they could tell me verbally and I could write it down. That is not how it works in the system. We have to show the VA that this is who we have service through and the amount that we are paying.
 I called again yesterday June 18,2015 and asked again for the information that I needed, I was told then that they could unbundle our bill and once we saw the information that we needed we could bundle our bill again, but that they could not guarantee that it would be the same price that we are paying right now. I asked to talk to a Supervisor who in turn told me the same thing. He told me that he can go to the information in our plan and click the plus button next to the plan we are on and that shows him the price of the internet and the modem. He stated that he could not e-mail me the information because of the chance of him or Comcast being held accountable. I then told him that I wanted to speak to someone higher up than him. He asked me who I thought that might be. I told him that he had to have a Boss and I wanted to speak to that person. He told me that they were off. Find it hard to believe. I then told him that there had to be a Number or a Place that I could talk to someone with higher authority than he has. He finally gave me a number to call and address to write to.
 I called the number and got a hold of someone in the Executive Customer Care department, who were helpful to a small extent. They escalated the issue to a higher position. I asked that they call me on my cell phone because I had things that I had to do. They did call but on our house phone, I did not get the message until after 6:30 with a case number to reference. The message stated that you could call between the hours of 8 AM to 7PM Monday thru Friday. I immediately tried to call and was directed to an answering machine; I left my information and have not had a return phone call. I gave them till 10:26 this morning and tried again and got the same voice mail message. I waited until 10:58 and called the number for the Executive Customer Care team again. I then explained again what was going on and advised that I again needed a call back to be on my cell phone. I still have yet to get a call back, so I tried again at 3:43 and got the same message, I called the Executive Customer Care Team at 3:45 PM. I told the woman that I spoke to that If I did not get a call back by 6:00PM I was contacting the Attorney General , The PUC, The FCC and whatever other agency that I needed to.
 It is now after 6:00PM on June 19, 2015. I am sending a copy of this letter to Comcast and all of the above mentioned agencies. We feel that we are not asking for anything that is not ours. This should have been as simple as where would you like this to be sent to.

Comcast Mistreatment,42145,Doraville,Georgia,30340,"I have been using comcast since late March of this year. Since the begining the speed of the Internet
 was no where near as advertised. I tolerated it for a week or two but it started to randomly crash
 every hour or so. This prevented me from doing the neccasary work I need to do so that I would be
 able to pay comcast at all. Also, I was recieving billing statements that weren't exactly trustworthy.
 Low and behold I called comcast to understand both problems. They had me on hold for times up to 2
 hours each day I tried to solve the problem. They continued to say that it was my problem for the
 lackluster internet. So, I try and be patient and I do as I was told would solve the problem and bought
 a new cable modem that they said would solve the problem entirely. Again, didn't work. I was forced
 to call again and remain on hold for a period of 2 hours waiting for a supervisor. I was told once again
 that there was nothing they could do but reimburse me for the days I didn't have any internet...20$.
 Now this concerns me because at this point in time I have been without internet for over a week and
 have spent up to 10 hours over the span of a week trying to resolve this issue. I have been hung up
 on and spent valuable time during work trying to figure out the problem, only to be told I am the
 problem.",,Internet Problems
Comcast Internet Service quality,42152,York,Pennsylvania,17403,"Comcast has not been giving me good Internet service. Quality of service is poor and their resolution
 timeline is also poor.
 I pay them approximately $85 a month.
 Six months ago, the connection kept dropping every few hours, then the frequency of dropped
 connections kept getting worse. Long story short, it took them a month to determine, that they had
 turned the power too high on the pole for the connection and that made the cable modem reboot. And
 they would not accept my diagnostics that the power was high. First they said that my cable modem
 has gone bad, I bought a new cable modem and the problem persisted. Only after the service
 technician came in did the matter get resolved, after a month of terrible service.
 On May 27th 2015, at about 3 PM EST, my service went down again. I contacted Comcast and their
 customer service went through the perfunctory politeness and transferred me to another service rep.
 She gave me the wrong information that there was a widespread outage and tried to keep selling me
 new services even after repeatedly telling her that I do not want to change my services. I had to call
 them again that this was not a widespread outage and they need to send a technician. Then I am
 told that they cannot send me a technician until Friday, that is almost 48 hours late.
 I telecommute and need to be home with my parents. Not only do I have to now drive to work but I
 cannot be with my parents who are not in the best of health. My home phone is a VOIP phone and
 my parents do not have a cellphone, in the event of an emergency, they have no recourse to contact
 me or emergency services.
 This level of service is deplorable. Within a span of six months, I have had two major problems with
 my service and Comcast has shown little willingness to help me proactively and prevent future
 problems. All they do is issue a credit for the time of outage. But what about my lost productivity and
 the risk to me? Comcast is the only choice I have for fast Internet and they act like an absolute
 monopoly when one looks at their service quality.",,Internet Problems
fraudulent charges,42124,Jupiter,Florida,33478,"My internet has not been working properly for months. Comcast the provider has been spoken to regarding this several times this year.
 Comcast service personnel to fix problem and unable to do so. Second time personnel serviced my home he found that the wiring for the internet and cable was old and outdated. Cable wiring was from Adelhia hich Comcast bought years back. Rep then explained to me what he had done how he had to rewire house and that another company would come out to bury cable. From then on the internet has worked without problems. Now Comcast wants to charge me 39.95 plus tax for this service. Now no one ever mentioned that I would be charged. When contacted Comcast for a credit they said 'NO"". Never mind all the months I paid for internet which I never received. As is I don't get my on demand when I request it, but I still pay for it every month.
 Prompt consideration to this matter is truly appreciated.

Yet, we incurred $10 Speed Boost charges after first month of using only 90% of 500GB. The speed boost charge is actually for data and this is deceiving to call it ""speed"". Secondly we incurred charges during the ""curtsey"" months. Monthly rate for modem lease jumped from $7 to $10 and it's the same equipment we've had for several years.

Comcast Bundled Services,42171,Lindenwold,New Jersey,8021,"I filed a complaint under request# 344358 regarding Comcast's billing me for phone services that were not received. However, since I am receiving ""bundled services"" from Comcast this same issues also apply to my Internet services. Since I am not certain whether both issues will be addressed in my previous request regarding the billing for non-existent phone services, I am also filing a complaint regarding Comcast's failure to properly give me credit for internet services which were likewise not received.
 In May of 2014, I changed my services with Comcast to ""Xfinity Bundled Services which included TV, home (wired) phone and internet. However, despite several complaints/service calls, I had no phone service until 8/24/14 (after yet another service call for which I was also billed) and in order to go online I had to unplug the TV from the modem and could not watch TV. It was either Internet or TV and no phone services at all.
 Since then I have tried to get credit for not having phone and Internet service from Comcast from 5/2014 through 8/24/14 but to no avail. After spending countless hours on numerous days waiting to speak with numerous customer service representative I was transferred from one agent to another and at one point even accused of fabricating stories. Finally, on 12/2/14 I was advised by one representative that I absolutely should receive credit for the months I had no phone or internet service unless I unplugged the TV. She did in fact apply a credit of $33.57 and advised that since the problem continued over a long period of time I should receive additional credit which would be issued by the ""review"" department and I should receive additional credit and a call from that department within 72 hours. I never received a call or additional credit but instead, the credit applied on 12/2/14 had been added back into my bill on 12/8/14. No explanation, no call or anything as to why that amount was added back into my bill. Further, when I made a payment by phone (unable to pay online), I was charged a fee of $5.99 which had been paid and properly credited on 12/9/14. That payment was then ""reversed"" and added to my bill again without any explanation. On 12/13/14, I spoke to a ""Mary"" (confirmation# CR418200120) who again advised that I was eligible to receive credit for the months without service and I would get additional credit by 12/15/14. Again, no credit, no calls, no explanation and I am still waiting for my credit. Subsequent telephone calls had the identical result: one person telling me ""my story did not match their records"" (to which I took great offense) and another one telling me I was eligible for a credit.
 In addition, Comcast has recently developed a new strategy to get even more money from customers by sending shut-off notices for non-payment to customers which arrive the day after the shut-off date and services are already disconnected which then results in a re-connection fee of $15.00. In addition, Comcast's practice of charging one month in advance is likewise absurd, especially when demand for such payment is made before restoring service. I have no problem paying for the services I receive but I should also receive credit when no service was provided. I really need help in getting this matter resolved since it is blatantly clear that Comcast will just continue to give me the run-
 around and refuses to resolve this matter. It should be noted that this complaint is not just for the phone service but also involves the lack of service for internet.

 It should be noted that Comcast AGAIN turned off services without any notices having been received advising of a possible interruption and despite the pending complaints.

ComCast continues to bill me though I canceled months ago,42148,Seattle,Washington,98109,"I took a 30 day trial of ComCast's internet service, and I canceled before the trial expired. They tried
 to talk me into staying, of course, but I was very clear that I wanted to cancel. I received phone calls
 from multiple individuals at ComCast, all of whom tried to talk me into remaining a customer. On the
 last call, the individual threatened that I had canceled a day AFTER the 30 day trial had expired,
 which, I informed him, was not true. I only had ComCast internet for a period of about 7 days before I
 canceled. That was in February, 2015.
 Ever since I canceled, they have been sending me bills. They indicate that the balance due is $54.34.
 Once in February they sent me a late notice, but ever since then they just send me a monthly bill. The
 odd thing is that the amount doesn't increase, and they don't send late notices anymore.
 When I call customer service, they tell me that my account does appear to be canceled, but they
 continue to bill me. I have wasted hours discussing the matter, and each time I have to explain the
 whole story from scratch.
 I have an excellent credit rating, and I want to be sure that it remains so. Furthermore, I consider it
 harassment to be sent bills month after month for a service that I canceled.
 Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks,

Comcast bundled service,42133,Commerce City,Colorado,80022,"I had Comcast Internet services/telephone,but decided to get their bundled service of, television and
 home security in March of 2015. I received a bill for $659 in April. My bill is usually $99 to $135. I
 called Comcast on April 10th and questioned why my bill was so high. I said I wanted items removed
 from my bill, such as the security and that I want a monthly payment to be no more than $200. The
 service rep said he removed them. We worked the monthly payment down to the price we agreed too.
 He got the overall bill down to $252 from the $659. This is what I paid at the end of April. However, in
 May,I received another bill for $754. This is after the $253 I paid for the April bill. I called Comcast
 they said they had no record of me calling in April to get these items adjusted on my bill. He is the
 kicker. I have proof and records that show that I spoke to Comcast for 31 minutes on April 10th. I told
 them I want everything removed and that I am closing my account because they are screwing me
 over. The said I would have to pay a $669 and $220 cancellation fees and the $754 bill. I only owe
 about $310 of the bill, not $754. I am writing a complaint to you because I cancelled a bunch of items
 and had a lot of items adjusted in April, yet they are still trying to charge me for them, on top of the
 installation fee for the home security. They want me to pay $1,643. How can I get this resolved?",,Billings

An apparent error on their behalf, the representative ""closed"" the account and made some ""follow up"" to ensure me that I would not be double billed. Well, not only was I billed in error by Comcast, they sent my ""disconnected"" unpaid bill to a Credit Management collection agency (855-657-8580). Because this is not my first time speaking to Comcast about billing issues with new service started in March 2015, I request a statement from Comcast to confirm that they were going to resolve this issue with the collection agency. A one month bill should have only been around $47 but the collection agency states that I owe Comcast $78.

 Comcast got in touch with me by phone and email. They were willing to allow us to discontinue the triple play and lower the rates (rather than what they have always said, which is that the rates go up). We cancelled our phone and are saving about $50/month for a year.
 However, the model they use is not fair to the consumer, or sustainable in the long run. I do not want to pay for stations that I don't watch (for example all the sports stations) even though Comcast has to pay for them. We need an alternative to the monopoly that Comcast has in Baltimore, thanks to our short-sighted local government.

Comcast Data usage meter,42123,Cartersville,Georgia,30120,"I believe Comcast is unfairly inflating their customers' internet usage and charging them overages that aren't actually occurring. I have seen my internet usage in Georgia approach the 'cap' every month and started noticing that the internet meter was still climbing (both on Comcast's website and the desktop app) even when all of the computers in the house were turned off while we have been out of town.
 This made me curious and I have done a few experiments in the past few weeks. I completely disconnected my Comcast cable modem from both the incoming cable and the power outlet, so the modem is completely turned off and no possibility of data usage should occur. I did this for a week. I made a note of the internet usage reported the next day from work (to make sure that the meter had completely updated). I then checked it a week later, and it had reported that I had used 28 GB of data. This is not possible. I did the same experiment a few weeks later, and it showed a usage of 19 GB. How is this physically possible? Comcast either has a major problem with their metering or they are intentionally inflating usage to cause charges for exceeding the cap.
 I have started looking at some of the forums online and am finding that other users are experiencing similar issues.
 Comcast should be investigated on this issue immediately. There is no actual justification for the data cap other than to take advantage of people's ignorance to how the internet works.
 I don't wish to give my full information at this time as I fear Comcast will harass me for reporting this.

So my initial contact to have my service moved from DC to MD was not a problem, it is the following issue that is now causing me to have to file a compliant against Comcast/Xfinity.

So if I can set up a new account without being in-person and over the phone why can't they provide me the PIN number to correct the mistake that their own people created in order for me to access my account and pay my bill? Sherita also stated that a supervisor would be calling me within 2 hours of the time of my call, the date of this conversation was on (4/27), today is April 30th and I still have yet to receive a 2 hour call back. Some supervisor, and I still have not received my PIN in the mail.

Comcast/xfinity,42104,Fall River,Massachusetts,2723,"I Though I had a triple bundle with xfinity When I first order my service I only had an Internet service with them I bough a house and decided to keep the service so when i called to do the service transfer the person I spoke with offer me a triple bundle to keep my internet plus the other two services (cable and home security service) I was clear with the Comcast rep. when i told him i wanted to keep my internet speed with the bundle. Recently i notice my internet wasn't what i used to have conduct a speed test and came out It wasn't close to what i was told. I been on the phone back and forward with the provider for days now and there's nothing they would do to fix the issue they changed my bundle it seems to be a nice package but at the end what they did was to add everything up to my current package which increased my monthly payment now they wont fix it at all..

Comcast Billing and Service Issues,42132,Falling Waters,West Virginia,25419,"Consumer has been charged for internet through Comcast. They are charging her over $300 when
 she never received internet service. They installed a modem but the service did not actually work.
 Then Comcast put in another box that said Hughes Net on it and then an Xfinity box. This did not
 work either but Comcast continued to charge her. Comcast refuses to do anything until she pays.
 She has three boxes at her house but no service. As a resolution, she would like Comcast to remove
 the $377 in charges since she never received the service and resolve the problem. ***CTR359-

Comcast Rates,42179,Memphis,Tennessee,38117,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking another package that included a cable subscription when I tried to switch to internet service only despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this new package was 60 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 88 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and just haven't watched cable television. For the past 2 years prior to making this recent switch, my bill for cable & internet was slowly creeping upwards from $124 a month until it recently reached $200 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but was told it would be CHEAPER to continue receiving a reduced level of ""cable"" (really just network channels & home shopping networks) along with internet than just internet alone. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 In addition, I have spoken to several other Comcast customers in my area who do in fact receive ONLY internet service for a substantially lower rate than what I was offered: $19 a month. And, these other customers have been receiving this rate for several years now (but only by calling and jumping through hoops each year to prevent rate hikes). Any honest and fair company would offer the same rates & services to all customers. But not Comcast. Oh no.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides reliable high speed service as defined by the FCC.
 Thank you,

Being charged for internet speeds that equipment can not deliver,42184,Santa Cruz,California,95060,"Comcast is charging for a service that their current equipment can not deliver. Customer representatives told me that with Blast my speed would be 50mbps. 30mbps was the fastest that I received. I was then told that I should have a download speed of 25 with a performance package. My actual speed was 18 Mbps. When a service tech came out to the house he told me that for all of Santa Cruz County the advertized speeds were not attainable until the system gets upgraded.
 I feel that Comcast should use the Blast service and have customers pay for the Performance package then at least the speed would be attainable

Please stop Broadband bandwidth caps,42138,Emeryville,California,94662,"Hello,
 I'd like to voice my support for any legislation enacted by the FCC that would ban broadband internet
 bandwidth caps. These caps are clearly just a scam by the Comcast, Cox and other residential ISP's
 to increase their bottom line with more and more people cutting cable television but keeping internet.
 Bandwidth costs have been coming down in the last few years, unlike what the ISP's want you to
 believe that these costs have increased.
 I have almost 20 years of IT industry experience and I tell you that bandwidth costs in the last few
 years has been decreasing at an even faster rate than ever before. Just a few years ago you would
 have to pay $10000+/mo for a gigabit fiber connection, now one can be had for $4-5k/month.
 This is clearly a way for ISP's to claim that their bandwidth is ""limited"" but in reality there's plenty of it.
 What is limited, is their neighborhood network ""nodes"" that are oversubscribed and they refuse to split
 them to alleviate congestion in order so that they can claim their network is ""congested"" to justify the
 bandwidth caps.
 These caps need to be stopped before they are rolled out nationwide like I'm sure Comcast and
 others want to do ASAP.
 With cloud services becoming the norm more and more lately bandwidth should be unlimited for
 consumers to benefit from these services.
 Thanks for your time.",,Internet Problems

 they've not notified ANY CUSTOMER that it will be down, the time frame for same or when it will be
 back up. I've exchanged modems which went bad, I've called stating I have no phone service (as I
 have the internet, television, phone - or maybe NOT). I've had to take my cell phone to bed with me or
 charge it in my car to be sure I don't lose that overnight! As I live alone, this is the most maddening of

 would call me back in 30 minutes and after 1.5 hours) tell me that service in the entire area where I
 live was down but the first person didn't tell me this - I could have gone in to work and been there but

Comcast Monopoly and Abuse,42168,Somerville,Massachusetts,2143,"I have no choice in who my internet provider is. I continually find my download rates throttled, and lowered, only to then receive the opportunity to pay more to speed up my connection (which only brings it back up to the original speed I had before they throttled my speed). I have no other options, so Comcast can continue to play this game of lowering my speed and charging me to get it back. This has enabled Comcast to ratchet up prices while not providing any improvements in service. I now pay 4 times what I used to, my internet is slower than ever, and I have no alternatives to chose from.
