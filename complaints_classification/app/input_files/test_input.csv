Comcast Internet,2015-06-07,Charleston,South Carolina,48230,"Our house has not one but two comcast internet boxes and both deliver less than average quality. Probably about 10 times a day, the internet box will kick off devices for absolutely no reason. This has been happening since November 2014. Basically when we are in the middle of browsing or streaming, the internet will stop working and according to the computer, I am connected to the network but have no internet connection. I then have to disconnect and reconnect. Once in a while, it won't even let me reconnect. I have had comcast come out to our house twice and tried to explain our issues but somehow the geniuses over at comcast can't understand the problem or the magnifying frustration that it causes. The Comcast tech guys tell me they see no problem and that it must be my computer. But this problem on happens with the comcast box internet, not any other network I try and conncet to. Furthermore, it happens to every device in our house including ipads, iphones, macs, and windows computers. Why is it so difficult for comcast to provide internet that is good quality. Also, when we moved into our apartment in August, it took comcast 17 days to finally come out and set up our internet even though I called a month in advance and they assured me that I could set it up my self despite the house never been wired for comcast before. I honestly think we need a new internet box and I tried to telling comcast that but they didn't listen to me. If I could switch to a different provider I would.

Comcast slamming/overcharge/,2015-04-27,Happy Valley,Oregon,97086,"I recently moved and had comcast transfer services to our new address. Once into the new house the tech support team could not get the internet/TV working one offered to have a tech come out and get everything set up for us and also credit our account 134.93. On the day that the tech came out our account was at a zero balance as they promised but them the charges were added to a ""new account"" that they set up for us the next month. There were undisclosed charges ($70.00) to my account for the tech coming out to our house to fix the problem they couldn't fix over both chat and phone. Plus then I was charged $100 (while the tech was at my house) for what they said was a deposit for services. I later learned was an upgrade service fee that was also undisclosed. A deposit would be refundable while a upgrade fee would not be considered refundable. (Why do I have to pay to upgrade my service and also a monthly service fee plus rental/lease for their modems/routers and DVR boxes?)
 Upon receiving my bill after moving I expected the billed amount to be around $145.00 but the new statement read 328.73 + the 134.93 that had been credited to my account prior for poor support and it was due immediately. There is also slamming charges to the account for a speed increase for internet that I did not order in the amount of $46.00 plus 37.09 for a partial month amount for this service as well. I called in and spent time in the billing department when that had no resolve I asked to be escalated to a supervisor which had also no effect in correcting the issue so I threatened to cancel my service which directed me to be transferred the loyalty (save) team for comcast customers. This is where I have spent many hours over the last 3 weeks trying to settle the difference of my account. I have been threatened, yelled at, verbally abused and harassed to pay this amount that they have slammed me for and have yet had no resolve. In fact they have gone as far as to disconnect my service twice and also reinstate it after many hours of arguing and raging complaints against their collections department employees. I have more knowledge of the calling tree and comcasts inner working departments than one non-comcast employee/customer would like to have. I have spent hours upon hours trying to get a bill fixed with handfuls of operator ID numbers, voice mails left for handfuls of supervisors and nothing shows resolve or even promise of resolve. I am fearful that they will send me to collections and hurt my credit rating if I cancel their service without payment but am not sure where else to turn or what else to do other than pay the as of today and the new billing cycle 682.65 dollars. ( new billing cycle came out last night, ugh) for what should be a $143.04 bill.

Comcast Very Bad /Rude customer service,2015-04-22,Johns Creek,Georgia,30097,"I am having comcast internet service in Johns creek GA. They charged me $161 for last month (Just internet service). This includes $39.99 service charge for technician to come and he didn't do anything inside. They were not supposed to charge.
 I have no other internet provider here and I am stuck with very bad customer service ( I don't expect this kind of service in USA). Even when i called for the service, CSR/Supervisor hung up his phone on me. Monopoly of Comcast internet service should go away , otherwise customers will suffer.

 According to what I have read in the paper and on line, Comcast/Xfinity will be issuing their customers a $5.00 credit for the days loss of telephone and internet, which doesn't seem enough for all the missed calls and emails. They have never before authorized a credit for any other time we were without service. We will have to wait and see if this truly happens. Thank you for your response.

Comcast bundling of internet and tv services and deceptive sales practices??,2015-06-29,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,15224,"I moved to a new house in Pittsburgh, PA 1 week ago and called a local comcast sales representative to set up internet service. I was told that the price for 105 Mbps (down)/ 25 Mbps (up) would be $59.99. The salesman then informed me that for an additional $5 per month, I would be able to get 80 channels in SD and stream those same channels in HD on my computer. I was told that I was not under any contracts and that I could drop the cable channels and streaming to return to the original $59.99 internet only plan. After trying and failing to get the streaming services to work satisfactorily, I attempted to cancel the cable channels and streaming and keep the internet only for $59.99. I was then told that cancelling the streaming would cause my bill to INCREASE to $78.99. The way in which the services are bundled forces the consumer to pay more money for less services and are artificially inflating my bill. Additional fees, including taxes on TV ($4.77) and ""Broadcast TV fee"" ($3.25) are also present on the bill, such that the true price of the cable addon is $5 + $3.25 + 4.77 = $13.02. These additional fees were not disclosed at the time of purchase. The practices used by comcast are deceptive and unfair. Comcast has not been helpful in resolving this issue.

Comcast Customer Service,2015-06-22,Aliquippa,Pennsylvania,15001,"We are trying to get an itemization of our Bill from Comcast / Xfinity. My husband is a disabled veteran and is going back to school so that he might be able to have a Career that will sustain for the rest of his years until he is at retirement age. Because of the help from the VA department he can be reimbursed for the portion of the bill that we pay for the internet. We have been trying to get an itemization so that we can submit it for reimbursement. Little did we know that this would end up being one of the hardest things to do? I have called last month and try to get the answer in writing. The Customer Service department told me that they could not do that, they told me that they could tell me verbally and I could write it down. That is not how it works in the system. We have to show the VA that this is who we have service through and the amount that we are paying.
 I called again yesterday June 18,2015 and asked again for the information that I needed, I was told then that they could unbundle our bill and once we saw the information that we needed we could bundle our bill again, but that they could not guarantee that it would be the same price that we are paying right now. I asked to talk to a Supervisor who in turn told me the same thing. He told me that he can go to the information in our plan and click the plus button next to the plan we are on and that shows him the price of the internet and the modem. He stated that he could not e-mail me the information because of the chance of him or Comcast being held accountable. I then told him that I wanted to speak to someone higher up than him. He asked me who I thought that might be. I told him that he had to have a Boss and I wanted to speak to that person. He told me that they were off. Find it hard to believe. I then told him that there had to be a Number or a Place that I could talk to someone with higher authority than he has. He finally gave me a number to call and address to write to.
 I called the number and got a hold of someone in the Executive Customer Care department, who were helpful to a small extent. They escalated the issue to a higher position. I asked that they call me on my cell phone because I had things that I had to do. They did call but on our house phone, I did not get the message until after 6:30 with a case number to reference. The message stated that you could call between the hours of 8 AM to 7PM Monday thru Friday. I immediately tried to call and was directed to an answering machine; I left my information and have not had a return phone call. I gave them till 10:26 this morning and tried again and got the same voice mail message. I waited until 10:58 and called the number for the Executive Customer Care team again. I then explained again what was going on and advised that I again needed a call back to be on my cell phone. I still have yet to get a call back, so I tried again at 3:43 and got the same message, I called the Executive Customer Care Team at 3:45 PM. I told the woman that I spoke to that If I did not get a call back by 6:00PM I was contacting the Attorney General , The PUC, The FCC and whatever other agency that I needed to.
 It is now after 6:00PM on June 19, 2015. I am sending a copy of this letter to Comcast and all of the above mentioned agencies. We feel that we are not asking for anything that is not ours. This should have been as simple as where would you like this to be sent to.

Comcast Mistreatment,2015-05-21,Doraville,Georgia,30340,"I have been using comcast since late March of this year. Since the begining the speed of the Internet
 was no where near as advertised. I tolerated it for a week or two but it started to randomly crash
 every hour or so. This prevented me from doing the neccasary work I need to do so that I would be
 able to pay comcast at all. Also, I was recieving billing statements that weren't exactly trustworthy.
 Low and behold I called comcast to understand both problems. They had me on hold for times up to 2
 hours each day I tried to solve the problem. They continued to say that it was my problem for the
 lackluster internet. So, I try and be patient and I do as I was told would solve the problem and bought
 a new cable modem that they said would solve the problem entirely. Again, didn't work. I was forced
 to call again and remain on hold for a period of 2 hours waiting for a supervisor. I was told once again
 that there was nothing they could do but reimburse me for the days I didn't have any internet...20$.
 Now this concerns me because at this point in time I have been without internet for over a week and
 have spent up to 10 hours over the span of a week trying to resolve this issue. I have been hung up
 on and spent valuable time during work trying to figure out the problem, only to be told I am the
 problem.",
Comcast Internet Service quality,2015-05-28,York,Pennsylvania,17403,"Comcast has not been giving me good Internet service. Quality of service is poor and their resolution
 timeline is also poor.
 I pay them approximately $85 a month.
 Six months ago, the connection kept dropping every few hours, then the frequency of dropped
 connections kept getting worse. Long story short, it took them a month to determine, that they had
 turned the power too high on the pole for the connection and that made the cable modem reboot. And
 they would not accept my diagnostics that the power was high. First they said that my cable modem
 has gone bad, I bought a new cable modem and the problem persisted. Only after the service
 technician came in did the matter get resolved, after a month of terrible service.
 On May 27th 2015, at about 3 PM EST, my service went down again. I contacted Comcast and their
 customer service went through the perfunctory politeness and transferred me to another service rep.
 She gave me the wrong information that there was a widespread outage and tried to keep selling me
 new services even after repeatedly telling her that I do not want to change my services. I had to call
 them again that this was not a widespread outage and they need to send a technician. Then I am
 told that they cannot send me a technician until Friday, that is almost 48 hours late.
 I telecommute and need to be home with my parents. Not only do I have to now drive to work but I
 cannot be with my parents who are not in the best of health. My home phone is a VOIP phone and
 my parents do not have a cellphone, in the event of an emergency, they have no recourse to contact
 me or emergency services.
 This level of service is deplorable. Within a span of six months, I have had two major problems with
 my service and Comcast has shown little willingness to help me proactively and prevent future
 problems. All they do is issue a credit for the time of outage. But what about my lost productivity and
 the risk to me? Comcast is the only choice I have for fast Internet and they act like an absolute
 monopoly when one looks at their service quality.",
fraudulent charges,2015-04-30,Jupiter,Florida,33478,"My internet has not been working properly for months. Comcast the provider has been spoken to regarding this several times this year.
 Comcast service personnel to fix problem and unable to do so. Second time personnel serviced my home he found that the wiring for the internet and cable was old and outdated. Cable wiring was from Adelhia hich Comcast bought years back. Rep then explained to me what he had done how he had to rewire house and that another company would come out to bury cable. From then on the internet has worked without problems. Now Comcast wants to charge me 39.95 plus tax for this service. Now no one ever mentioned that I would be charged. When contacted Comcast for a credit they said 'NO"". Never mind all the months I paid for internet which I never received. As is I don't get my on demand when I request it, but I still pay for it every month.
 Prompt consideration to this matter is truly appreciated.

Billing & Data Usage,2015-06-23,Canton,Mississippi,39046,"Comcast notified of three courtesy months of exceeding 500GB per month data usage. Yet, we incurred $10 Speed Boost charges after first month of using only 90% of 500GB. The speed boost charge is actually for data and this is deceiving to call it ""speed"". Secondly we incurred charges during the ""curtsey"" months. Monthly rate for modem lease jumped from $7 to $10 and it's the same equipment we've had for several years. Why should we pay more without being notified for equipment that's the same, not newer? Each time we attempt to call billing we're disconnected so I cannot speak with a representative about our billing inconsistencies.

Comcast data caps,2015-04-24,Collierville,Tennessee,38017,"I am being pseudo-billed (1 last allowance until they start charging) on overages based on an inaccurate data counter by Comcast. With the size of games, and media (4k netflix, amazon, etc) Comcast should no longer be able to advertise their ""services"" as something ""gamers would want,"" because we burn through our ""allotted data"" in less than a week and get charged for overages.

Comcast Bundled Services,2015-06-16,Lindenwold,New Jersey,8021,"I filed a complaint under request# 344358 regarding Comcast's billing me for phone services that were not received. However, since I am receiving ""bundled services"" from Comcast this same issues also apply to my Internet services. Since I am not certain whether both issues will be addressed in my previous request regarding the billing for non-existent phone services, I am also filing a complaint regarding Comcast's failure to properly give me credit for internet services which were likewise not received.
 In May of 2014, I changed my services with Comcast to ""Xfinity Bundled Services which included TV, home (wired) phone and internet. However, despite several complaints/service calls, I had no phone service until 8/24/14 (after yet another service call for which I was also billed) and in order to go online I had to unplug the TV from the modem and could not watch TV. It was either Internet or TV and no phone services at all.
 Since then I have tried to get credit for not having phone and Internet service from Comcast from 5/2014 through 8/24/14 but to no avail. After spending countless hours on numerous days waiting to speak with numerous customer service representative I was transferred from one agent to another and at one point even accused of fabricating stories. Finally, on 12/2/14 I was advised by one representative that I absolutely should receive credit for the months I had no phone or internet service unless I unplugged the TV. She did in fact apply a credit of $33.57 and advised that since the problem continued over a long period of time I should receive additional credit which would be issued by the ""review"" department and I should receive additional credit and a call from that department within 72 hours. I never received a call or additional credit but instead, the credit applied on 12/2/14 had been added back into my bill on 12/8/14. No explanation, no call or anything as to why that amount was added back into my bill. Further, when I made a payment by phone (unable to pay online), I was charged a fee of $5.99 which had been paid and properly credited on 12/9/14. That payment was then ""reversed"" and added to my bill again without any explanation. On 12/13/14, I spoke to a ""Mary"" (confirmation# CR418200120) who again advised that I was eligible to receive credit for the months without service and I would get additional credit by 12/15/14. Again, no credit, no calls, no explanation and I am still waiting for my credit. Subsequent telephone calls had the identical result: one person telling me ""my story did not match their records"" (to which I took great offense) and another one telling me I was eligible for a credit.
 In addition, Comcast has recently developed a new strategy to get even more money from customers by sending shut-off notices for non-payment to customers which arrive the day after the shut-off date and services are already disconnected which then results in a re-connection fee of $15.00. In addition, Comcast's practice of charging one month in advance is likewise absurd, especially when demand for such payment is made before restoring service. I have no problem paying for the services I receive but I should also receive credit when no service was provided. I really need help in getting this matter resolved since it is blatantly clear that Comcast will just continue to give me the run-
 around and refuses to resolve this matter. It should be noted that this complaint is not just for the phone service but also involves the lack of service for internet.

 It should be noted that Comcast AGAIN turned off services without any notices having been received advising of a possible interruption and despite the pending complaints. This is indicative of Comcast's attitude towards its customers who, unfortunately, have no other alternatives for cable services. I am asking again that Comcast be restrained from interrupting services until the issue of credit and its practice of interrupting services before any notices are sent out."
ComCast continues to bill me though I canceled months ago,2015-05-24,Seattle,Washington,98109,"I took a 30 day trial of ComCast's internet service, and I canceled before the trial expired. They tried
 to talk me into staying, of course, but I was very clear that I wanted to cancel. I received phone calls
 from multiple individuals at ComCast, all of whom tried to talk me into remaining a customer. On the
 last call, the individual threatened that I had canceled a day AFTER the 30 day trial had expired,
 which, I informed him, was not true. I only had ComCast internet for a period of about 7 days before I
 canceled. That was in February, 2015.
 Ever since I canceled, they have been sending me bills. They indicate that the balance due is $54.34.
 Once in February they sent me a late notice, but ever since then they just send me a monthly bill. The
 odd thing is that the amount doesn't increase, and they don't send late notices anymore.
 When I call customer service, they tell me that my account does appear to be canceled, but they
 continue to bill me. I have wasted hours discussing the matter, and each time I have to explain the
 whole story from scratch.
 I have an excellent credit rating, and I want to be sure that it remains so. Furthermore, I consider it
 harassment to be sent bills month after month for a service that I canceled.
 Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks,

Comcast bundled service,2015-05-09,Commerce City,Colorado,80022,"I had Comcast Internet services/telephone,but decided to get their bundled service of, television and
 home security in March of 2015. I received a bill for $659 in April. My bill is usually $99 to $135. I
 called Comcast on April 10th and questioned why my bill was so high. I said I wanted items removed
 from my bill, such as the security and that I want a monthly payment to be no more than $200. The
 service rep said he removed them. We worked the monthly payment down to the price we agreed too.
 He got the overall bill down to $252 from the $659. This is what I paid at the end of April. However, in
 May,I received another bill for $754. This is after the $253 I paid for the April bill. I called Comcast
 they said they had no record of me calling in April to get these items adjusted on my bill. He is the
 kicker. I have proof and records that show that I spoke to Comcast for 31 minutes on April 10th. I told
 them I want everything removed and that I am closing my account because they are screwing me
 over. The said I would have to pay a $669 and $220 cancellation fees and the $754 bill. I only owe
 about $310 of the bill, not $754. I am writing a complaint to you because I cancelled a bunch of items
 and had a lot of items adjusted in April, yet they are still trying to charge me for them, on top of the
 installation fee for the home security. They want me to pay $1,643. How can I get this resolved?",

Comcast wants no restriction, unfettered access, ability to construct and or destruct and an unending right to property they don’t own.

At the store (April 2015), I learned that Comcast created 2 ""new"" accounts for the same services (tv and internet). An apparent error on their behalf, the representative ""closed"" the account and made some ""follow up"" to ensure me that I would not be double billed. Well, not only was I billed in error by Comcast, they sent my ""disconnected"" unpaid bill to a Credit Management collection agency (855-657-8580). Because this is not my first time speaking to Comcast about billing issues with new service started in March 2015, I request a statement from Comcast to confirm that they were going to resolve this issue with the collection agency. A one month bill should have only been around $47 but the collection agency states that I owe Comcast $78. How could that be when I am a current customer and the error was brought to their attention the next month by me?

 Comcast got in touch with me by phone and email. They were willing to allow us to discontinue the triple play and lower the rates (rather than what they have always said, which is that the rates go up). We cancelled our phone and are saving about $50/month for a year.
 However, the model they use is not fair to the consumer, or sustainable in the long run. I do not want to pay for stations that I don't watch (for example all the sports stations) even though Comcast has to pay for them. We need an alternative to the monopoly that Comcast has in Baltimore, thanks to our short-sighted local government.

Comcast Data usage meter,2015-04-29,Cartersville,Georgia,30120,"I believe Comcast is unfairly inflating their customers' internet usage and charging them overages that aren't actually occurring. I have seen my internet usage in Georgia approach the 'cap' every month and started noticing that the internet meter was still climbing (both on Comcast's website and the desktop app) even when all of the computers in the house were turned off while we have been out of town.
 This made me curious and I have done a few experiments in the past few weeks. I completely disconnected my Comcast cable modem from both the incoming cable and the power outlet, so the modem is completely turned off and no possibility of data usage should occur. I did this for a week. I made a note of the internet usage reported the next day from work (to make sure that the meter had completely updated). I then checked it a week later, and it had reported that I had used 28 GB of data. This is not possible. I did the same experiment a few weeks later, and it showed a usage of 19 GB. How is this physically possible? Comcast either has a major problem with their metering or they are intentionally inflating usage to cause charges for exceeding the cap.
 I have started looking at some of the forums online and am finding that other users are experiencing similar issues.
 Comcast should be investigated on this issue immediately. There is no actual justification for the data cap other than to take advantage of people's ignorance to how the internet works.
 I don't wish to give my full information at this time as I fear Comcast will harass me for reporting this.

So my initial contact to have my service moved from DC to MD was not a problem, it is the following issue that is now causing me to have to file a compliant against Comcast/Xfinity.

So Sherita explained that since they can not verify who I was over the phone, they could not change nor provide me with a PIN to change the account settings. Even though during their prompts and live conversation at initial hook up, they ask for you to verify the name on account, last 4 digits of SSN, home address and your account number. So if I can set up a new account without being in-person and over the phone why can't they provide me the PIN number to correct the mistake that their own people created in order for me to access my account and pay my bill? Sherita also stated that a supervisor would be calling me within 2 hours of the time of my call, the date of this conversation was on (4/27), today is April 30th and I still have yet to receive a 2 hour call back. Some supervisor, and I still have not received my PIN in the mail.

Comcast/xfinity,2015-04-10,Fall River,Massachusetts,2723,"I Though I had a triple bundle with xfinity When I first order my service I only had an Internet service with them I bough a house and decided to keep the service so when i called to do the service transfer the person I spoke with offer me a triple bundle to keep my internet plus the other two services (cable and home security service) I was clear with the Comcast rep. when i told him i wanted to keep my internet speed with the bundle. Recently i notice my internet wasn't what i used to have conduct a speed test and came out It wasn't close to what i was told. I been on the phone back and forward with the provider for days now and there's nothing they would do to fix the issue they changed my bundle it seems to be a nice package but at the end what they did was to add everything up to my current package which increased my monthly payment now they wont fix it at all..

Comcast Billing and Service Issues,2015-05-08,Falling Waters,West Virginia,25419,"Consumer has been charged for internet through Comcast. They are charging her over $300 when
 she never received internet service. They installed a modem but the service did not actually work.
 Then Comcast put in another box that said Hughes Net on it and then an Xfinity box. This did not
 work either but Comcast continued to charge her. Comcast refuses to do anything until she pays.
 She has three boxes at her house but no service. As a resolution, she would like Comcast to remove
 the $377 in charges since she never received the service and resolve the problem. ***CTR359-

Comcast Rates,2015-06-24,Memphis,Tennessee,38117,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking another package that included a cable subscription when I tried to switch to internet service only despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this new package was 60 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 88 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and just haven't watched cable television. For the past 2 years prior to making this recent switch, my bill for cable & internet was slowly creeping upwards from $124 a month until it recently reached $200 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but was told it would be CHEAPER to continue receiving a reduced level of ""cable"" (really just network channels & home shopping networks) along with internet than just internet alone. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 In addition, I have spoken to several other Comcast customers in my area who do in fact receive ONLY internet service for a substantially lower rate than what I was offered: $19 a month. And, these other customers have been receiving this rate for several years now (but only by calling and jumping through hoops each year to prevent rate hikes). Any honest and fair company would offer the same rates & services to all customers. But not Comcast. Oh no.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides reliable high speed service as defined by the FCC.
 Thank you,

Being charged for internet speeds that equipment can not deliver,2015-06-29,Santa Cruz,California,95060,"Comcast is charging for a service that their current equipment can not deliver. Customer representatives told me that with Blast my speed would be 50mbps. 30mbps was the fastest that I received. I was then told that I should have a download speed of 25 with a performance package. My actual speed was 18 Mbps. When a service tech came out to the house he told me that for all of Santa Cruz County the advertized speeds were not attainable until the system gets upgraded.
 I feel that Comcast should use the Blast service and have customers pay for the Performance package then at least the speed would be attainable

Please stop Broadband bandwidth caps,2015-05-14,Emeryville,California,94662,"Hello,
 I'd like to voice my support for any legislation enacted by the FCC that would ban broadband internet
 bandwidth caps. These caps are clearly just a scam by the Comcast, Cox and other residential ISP's
 to increase their bottom line with more and more people cutting cable television but keeping internet.
 Bandwidth costs have been coming down in the last few years, unlike what the ISP's want you to
 believe that these costs have increased.
 I have almost 20 years of IT industry experience and I tell you that bandwidth costs in the last few
 years has been decreasing at an even faster rate than ever before. Just a few years ago you would
 have to pay $10000+/mo for a gigabit fiber connection, now one can be had for $4-5k/month.
 This is clearly a way for ISP's to claim that their bandwidth is ""limited"" but in reality there's plenty of it.
 What is limited, is their neighborhood network ""nodes"" that are oversubscribed and they refuse to split
 them to alleviate congestion in order so that they can claim their network is ""congested"" to justify the
 bandwidth caps.
 These caps need to be stopped before they are rolled out nationwide like I'm sure Comcast and
 others want to do ASAP.
 With cloud services becoming the norm more and more lately bandwidth should be unlimited for
 consumers to benefit from these services.
 Thanks for your time.",

 have the internet, television, phone - or maybe NOT). I've had to take my cell phone to bed with me or
 charge it in my car to be sure I don't lose that overnight! As I live alone, this is the most maddening of

Comcast Monopoly and Abuse,2015-06-13,Somerville,Massachusetts,2143,"I have no choice in who my internet provider is. I continually find my download rates throttled, and lowered, only to then receive the opportunity to pay more to speed up my connection (which only brings it back up to the original speed I had before they throttled my speed). I have no other options, so Comcast can continue to play this game of lowering my speed and charging me to get it back. This has enabled Comcast to ratchet up prices while not providing any improvements in service. I now pay 4 times what I used to, my internet is slower than ever, and I have no alternatives to chose from. This is not fair, this is not a free market, and this is an unacceptable state of affairs for the United States of America.

Nonsensical Raise in my Internet Bill,2015-06-24,Coral Gables,Florida,33134,"My internet bill was recently raised by $20/mo. I do not understand why I should be charged more by my ISP for the same exact internet service I received for a year. If the service in question can be afforded to me and others for a set rate, why then should that rate be increased for no reason? I've attached documentation of the discrepancies in my billing. Although I've received the same exact services over the last 3 months (Xfinity Internet Package, HBO), the billing of these services constantly fluctuate. This is essentially like raising the cost of a toll on a highway, except there are no inflationary reasons given as to why it's suddenly more expensive, it just is. What I pay for internet doubled and ISP's shouldn't be allowed to raise your rate by such a significant amount, especially with no explanation as to why beyond ""your introductory period has lapsed."" This shouldn't be allowed. Thank you.

disconnection of service,2015-06-15,Atlanta,Georgia,30306,"To whom this concerns
 I have had an very poor experience with comcast as an internet provider and their poor communication and lack of follow through is the worst customer service I have ever encountered. On Thursday June 11th I placed a call in which a customer service representative instructed me I could cancel my service at the end of the month and drop off my cable box at my convenience with continuation of my internet service. The following day the box was turned in and to my surprise they discontinued my internet service as well. When I called they said it was because I did not pay my bill (though I am on auto-pay). Over the next two days I spent 3-4 hours on the phone and no one was able to re issue my service. They said they would call yesterday and no one has contacted me. Being that I work at the hospital and manage patient care it is extremely important that I access patient records during any time of the day or night. Because of this inconvenience it has caused a lot of problems for me.

Comcast refusing to fix connectivity issues,2015-05-04,Sunnyvale,California,94087,"Our internet keeps getting disconnected every few minutes making it impossible to do even the basic
 browsing from home on any device wireless / wired. Called comcast today and they say they will not
 send the technician to fix it since they don't see the problem on their end. My neighbor is having
 issues as well and they got the same response. We feel cheated and feel like this company is taking
 advantage of it being the only provider in our neighborhood.",
Not receiving advertised speed,2015-06-12,Galesburg,Michigan,49053,"We pay Comcast for an advertised download speed of over 100mbps, but no matter what we try, our downloads are hard capped at 60mbps. When we upgraded from a 50mbps package (hard capped at 30mbps), we could magically reach the previously unobtainable speed of 60mbps. I don't believe for a second that it is a hardware* bottleneck since Comcast offers a 250mbps package; rather, I feel that we (and all other customers in the area) are being taken advantage of and being pushed into upgrading our packages just to reach the speeds we were promised in our current tier.
 We just want the speeds we're paying for.
 *Comcast hardware. Our router and modem are rated for much higher speeds.

complaint regarding Comcast,2015-04-28,Chicago,Illinois,60641,"I've made multiple payment arrangements and everytime they never end up following through, then disconnect my services. I then call and get bounced around to an average of 6 ppl. Finally I get someone and they say it was never in the system. Then they took my payment for $224.42 and when I check later they decided to charge me that amount twice. Causing my account to go negative. Of course they're going to charge me for reactivation fees etc. Every month, every time it's the same call I have to make and they never seem to get it right. No matter if I go on Twitter or any other social media options. I don't know how they are still in business. I'm basically paying car payment prices just for cable and internet.

Comcast Service and Customer Service,2015-06-23,South Bend,Indiana,46637,"I have had multiple issues with my Comcast service since signing my contract with them. I have spent hours of my time on the phone with their ""customer service"" and have not one time been satisfied with the outcome. I always get the run-around from every employee and not one of them has ever resolved my issue. My cable TV system constantly freezes, or says ""xfinity service is currently not available, please try back later"". And I was told that we were receiving ""fast in-home wifi"" for our tiny apartment, but still can't even watch a single video without it constantly freezing. And this is even when there is one device connect to the wifi.. Even though we were told you could use multiple devices at once. I have finally given up trying to get help from Comcast because they seem like they could not care any less about my situation, but still continue to take my payment every month. Therefore I looked around online and saw that I could file a complaint through the FCC, and here I am. I just don't understand how a company can be so unresponsive, unhelpful and deceptive as Comcast. I have never been more unhappy with a company in my entire life.

Billing for equipment that was not provided to me,2015-05-15,Boca Raton,Florida,33496,"I have had service with Comcast at my home since 1999. I have always had my own modem for the
 internet connection with Comcast. In 2008 I asked Comcast to no longer provide me with television
 services and only provide me with internet access. I have always had my own modem for the internet
 access and NEVER leased a Comcast modem. I always had my bills paid automatically with direct
 charge to my credit card. In February 2015 I noticed that my bill increased. I reviewed the bill in
 detail and noticed that Comcast has been charging me for the television services and for leasing of a
 modem. I was able to access prior bills for only 9 months and all of them had the same charges. I
 contacted Comcast in February of 2015 and was on the phone with several representatives. I was
 assured that their accounting department will research this matter and refund me the money that was
 charged to me. I contacted Comcast twice since then and was told that the matter is being
 researched. As of today 5-15-2015, I have not received any communication or refund of the wrongful
 charges.
 I called Comcast today once again, because a $70 charge was noted on my bill due in two days for a
 service call. In fact we lost our Comcast Internet connection for 1 week last month. A service
 technician was called . Comcast informed me that we had to wait for 6 days for a technician to come.
 When he came, the technician identified a problem outside our home with a Comcast cable. He
 performed the repairs, all outside our home and restored the service. When I called today to dispute
 the $70 charge I was told by a representative that the paperwork showed that repairs were performed
 INSIDE my home. I stated to the representative that it is not true, and in fact to this day the new
 cable has not been berried in the ground and remains a danger to me and my family. The
 representative informed me that they will have to research the issue and determine if the repairs were
 performed inside or outside my home.
 Clearly Comcast is engaged in unlawful and deliberate overcharging to their customers for the
 equipment and services that area not performed. I am attaching the available bills as evidence of
 these problems with Comcast.

 with my complaint but have not made any refunds and therefore have not resolved it.

Comcast 300Gb Data Cap,2015-06-26,Marietta,Georgia,30066,"Comcast started imposing Data Cap of 300Gb per month as the limit of allowed data consumption, and began charging penalty 10$ charge for each 50Gb over that limit.

Comcast Business Internet,2015-06-11,West Palm Beach,Florida,33407,"Good evening,
 Back in 2013 I was living in a cottage at a scuba club. Because I lived at the scuba club, I was told I MUST have a business account for my small cottage. The rate for JUST internet is $89 a month, and I was put into a contract until 2016. It was not until after I signed my paperwork that I realized I was locked into a Comcast Business contract, which has over a $1,000 fee to get out of. I called Comcast several times, explained that I was a schoolteacher and was not affiliated, worked for, or even had my own business, but, they said they could do nothing.
 Fast forward now to June of 2015. I moved to a new location about 6 weeks ago. Comcast has come to set up/transfer my internet 3 times and was unable to successfully do that. The second time they came they were 2 hours and 45 minutes late (past my 1-3 time frame). When they did arrive they said they had to put in a new line, which would require a ""bury team"" to later come on a DIFFERENT day and bury it. But, because I had a dog and they would have to bury it in my driveway, they could not leave it above ground.
 Finally, a technician came for a third time, again without a bury crew, and reiterated the same thing. I had been assured at the previous visit that a bury crew and technicians would come at the same time. Then, 3 days later, I come home from work (with NO knowledge that this would happen) and find the line buried in the ground, except it is attached to the house in front of my house. I was not given a phone call or any time of warning that this would happen. I was also not present when it happened. Is this even legal? Now I have to explain to the people in the house in front of me why there is a new box and orange lines drilled into the side of their house?!
 I pay $89 for business internet until 2016 without any affiliation with a business, have gone 6 weeks with no internet, and now have Comcast technicians drilling and putting lines on the wrong home without my knowledge or consent or me being present during the time of digging.

Comcast Billing Practices,2015-06-30,Detroit,Michigan,48214,"It seems that Comcast puts unnecessary line items on customers' bills, just to see if they can get away with it. When I recently moved, Comcast billed me $15 for a Self Install Kit that I did not need and never received - I have my own equipment, and I installed it myself. When I called to dispute the charge, I was told that the charge was in error, but it took several more phone calls to actually get it removed from my bill. It is incredibly frustrating to deal with Comcast, and I constantly feel like they are trying to trick me and cheat me out of money.

Comcast ignores my requests to cancel a service and instead added product to my bill and increased the monthly cost.,2015-06-25,Sandy Springs,Georgia,31150,"Comcast refused to cancel my phone service which it guarantees to cancel within 30 days of installation or money back. I ought not to pay for a service that I am not able to cancel. Comcast not only ignores my request for cancellation but the company added a new line of business and increased my monthly bill without my consent.
 On June 17, 2015 I telephoned Comcast and requested to revert services from internet and phone to what I had two weeks prior which was video and internet service. The reversion was based on the 30-day money back guarantee which stated that everything will be as though no change was made including reversion to original price.
 A week after the request, I removed the Comcast modem, switched to my own modem, and got no internet service. I contacted Comcast and was informed that a pending phone disconnect order was blocking use of my own modem. Again I repeated my request to have the phone removed. After some wait, I was asked to replace my modem with the Comcast modem. I did so and got internet access. I was compelled to give further time for the pending disconnect request to process.
 June 25th there was no internet access with the Comcast modem. I again contacted Comcast. While on the phone I asked to switch to my modem and they agreed. They could not get me internet access. They explained that the Comcast phone services on the account necessitated use of the Comcast modem. I was surprised that since I made the cancellation request on the 17th that the phone was still on my account. I removed my modem and plugged in the Comcast modem. The technician did some troubleshooting and when I still had no internet access he cold transferred me to Customer Solutions.
 After once again going through the verification process of providing all the information this next agent required from me, the agent reviewed my account and offered me a $99 Triple Play (phone, internet and video services) which I declined. I reminded her my purpose to get internet access and to see that the phone service is canceled. Further, that the Comcast video equipment remains in an unopened box in my living room. It would not make sense to add more services which I don’t use. Her disapproving tone and continued sales pitch was unexpected. I was forced to repeat a few more times that I have no need of a Triple Play bundle and that I had called to revert back to my original Double Play of Internet and video only. Next thing I was cold transferred to the Activation Dept.
 As in the previous departments, I went through the verification process. The Activation agent got my phone working. I thanked her and asked to speak with a supervisor so I could get a final resolution to the request to cancel the phone. After some wait, I was informed that a supervisor was not available.
 The call ended. That same morning of June 25th, I received a confirmation invoice from Comcast. The invoice showed that a Triple play bundle was added to my account along with increased price.
 My normal monthly bill is $69 ($54 for the basic Double Play and $10 for the Comcast modem and fees). The confirmation invoice shows an increase to $135.29 after a one-month discount of $40. The next bill therefore is expected to be $175. The information also does not reflect the offer which I declined. I had declined a $99 Triple play.
 Comcast forces its service on me. I ought not to pay for a service that I am not able to cancel. Comcast not only ignores my request for cancellation but the company added a new line of business and increased my monthly bill without my consent.

 Thank you for the update. According to a statement from Comcast, the telephone service has been canceled. However, Comcast has not adjusted my bill.

Monthly Charges Increased without any notice,2015-05-23,Beltsville,Maryland,20705,"I have signed a two years internet service promotion with comcast on 05/12/ 2013 for $19.99 a year
 and after that for 34.99 for the second year. After the first year promotional period I received a letter
 that the promotional offer is over and the charges is at $34.99 for the second year which I accepted.
 On
 January 2015 I received a call the they are providing new router for better service and i ask the caller
 if it is free and he say yes. In Feb. 2015 I received a bill with extra $10.00 for the rental of the said
 router. I just didn't call but accept it. On May 2015 I received a bill that my charges have increase to
 $77.55 without any notice or consent from me. I call to tell them why is this and they just say the
 promotional period is over. I ask them why I was not informed about the increase and whether I am
 willing to accept the huge increase. What if you just sent me a bill for $200.00 or more I have no
 choice but to pay??? The say the don't practise that. I call them to cancel it right away with effect the
 same day and they told me it take few days to do that.",
invalid sercvice charge,2015-04-19,Portland,Oregon,97202,"My compliant is concerning Comcast internet service. I was having an issue with my internet being slow. I called Comcast customer services and was connected with and advanced tech service representative to help problem solve the issues. The tech services representative person said they could not fix the issue over the phone and a Comcast tech person needed to come to my home to fix the problem. I asked if I would be charged for this service and they said, ""no"". I asked them if they were sure and they told me it was an issue with Comcast and not my equipment. I made an appointment to have a tech service person come to my home and fix the issues. The tech person came to home and took some readings of my modem. He said the modem was being hit with to much signal, which is a common issue people have been experiencing since Comcast increased the internet signal output. I think he said they did this in December or Jan. He then put two metal things on the back of my modem to decrease the signal. This did not actually fix the issue and my internet was still slow. At no point in time did he tell me I would be charged for the service he was providing. On my next bill from Comcast I had a 71.50 for a residential trouble call.
 I called the comcast billing department and explained to them what had happened. The costumer service representative I spoke was named ALex. She told me she could only remove half of the bill, because it was a valid charge. She said she spoke with her manager and he said that all they could do was take off half of the charge and offered me free premium channels. Alex said that it did not matter that the tech service representative told me there would be no charge. It only mattered what the tech person wrote down who provided the service at my home. I explained to Alex, that the tech person did not at any point inform me that I would be charged for the service he provided. If he had I would have declined the service. She told me that did not matter they could not remove the charge and no one else would be able to remove the charge. Alex again offered to take off half the cost of the service charge and give some premium channels. She refused to give me her last name or the name of the manager she consulted with, for security reasons.

Comcast service and billing,2015-06-23,Tucson,Arizona,85745,"We began service in Tucson last April 2014 with Comcast when we moved here from Portland OR. Our pricing was $39.99/month for 50 Mb service, same as in Portland. However, Comcast has slowly jacked the price up to $78.95/month and won't consider lowering it unless I also buy additional services (IP phone, TV, etc.), which I neither need nor want. Obviously the price it is willing to offer is not based on the service but on its desire to maximize profit at consumer expense. Compounding the problem, Comcast has recently also placed - without our consent or advance notice - a data cap on our service so that if we exceed 3.5 Gb/month we get incur substantial extra charges. We never had this in Portland or here in Tucson until the last couple of months. Again, we never agreed to this. As a direct result, we are now afraid to use our internet. Things like Netflix, to which we subscribe, Apple TV, or on demand services through our satellite TV service, which require use of the internet to download a show, now loom like threats rather than additional entertainment options. Comcast says it will warn us if we approach the limit, but this is not the service we signed up for. We don't want to live in fear of an excess charge or be worried that we are reaching the limit. Making matters worse, Comcast's service in our area is terrible in the evenings. Almost every evening we run into unbearably slow internet speeds, and frequently nothing will load at all. The only time it provides consistent, high speed service is the daytime, when neither of us is regularly home. With pricing now doubled and service worse than ever, we wonder why Comcast is allowed to charge what it does. The 50 Mb service is nowhere near what it advertises for our home.

Internet Service,2015-05-06,Burlington,West Virginia,26710,"My wife and I run a business from our home in Burlington, Wv. and have spotty internet service at

Billing & Internet Service Issues with Comcast in Seattle WA,2015-06-03,Seattle,Washington,98117,"I have both internet and cable tv through Comcast. I have a special low-income phone with Century Link via the WA state Telephone Assistance Plan so I don't qualify for Comcast major discounts such as triple play. I am a single mom with a disability (autoimmune health issues) and a child with special needs. We value being able to watch tv as a souce of low cost entertainment. I have to call each month to dispute the Comcast bill because it comes for a higher $ amount than what has been quoted to me by customer service. I have the names and dates of each time I have called in the last year and a half - just in last 6 months I have spoken with 5 different service people in 5 of 6 months. Each month they give me credits and we agree on the amt. the next bill should come for and the next month it comes for a higher amount. It takes a lot of time on the phone each time I call to explain what the problem is so sometimes it takes me a while to make the call and then late fees are added to my bill. You can see that I have paid consistently each month, but not by the due date each month. With my disability (health issues) I often don't feel good and it takes so much energy to gather my thoughts, notes that is takes me a while to call - I won't pay until the bill is adjusted to the agreed amount. I am only willing to pay $120 for combined internet & cable tv. This has become so stressfull that I am close to just cancelling with comcast all together. It is not fair for comcast to continue to make promises on what the monthly bill amount will be and then not keep them. They offer internet for low income, but the speed was so low it did not work to stream movies or search on the internet so I got a regular priced plan. There has to be a way I can get decent internet service with a high enough speed to stream movies and reasonably surf internet and basic cable tv with access to on-demand for not more then $100 to MAX $120 per month. (Sometimes we like to have HBO or Starz but usually only 1 at a time.) We by no means have any kind of deluxe package.) I should not have to call each month and negotiate for discounts and be lied to about promotions I'm being put on that will keep the bill at the agreed $120. Then I see constant offers where they are offering new customers phone, internet & tv for $99 but I can't get two out of the three for a consistant $120 Max. Please help. Sincerely, (PS In addition to the billing issue our wireless internet has not worked well for 12 of the 18 months we've had it at this address. We live in a less then 900 sq. ft home and have to use a wi-fi extender just to get wi-fi one room away from modem - so in addition to billing issues the internet service doesn't work well either.)

"Billed for modem rental for several years, Comcast refuses to refund under ""caveat emptor""",2015-05-27,Deptford,New Jersey,8096,"On May 15, 2015, I contacted Comcast customer service to set up a newly purchased modem on my
 account. The representative I spoke with that day noted that they would no longer charge us for a
 modem rental going forward. I asked her to look further into it, because I have never rented a modem
 from Comcast. She researched the issue and informed me that the billing error had been occurring
 since November 2009. She created a ticket to have the error corrected and our account adjusted
 (Ref# 029052678) and said we should call back in 5 business days.
 On May 26, 2015, 6 business days later, I followed up on the status of the request with Comcast
 customer service. The representative, Marcus, repeatedly denied that they would be able to confirm
 whether the error had occurred for that length of time, as their records ""only go back one year,"" which
 is completely inconsistent with what the representative I spoke with on 5/15 told me. Marcus also
 informed me that they would be refunding me for one month, or $6.45, of the overpayments, because
 it is my responsibility to verify that their billing is accurate. At that point, I asked to speak with a
 supervisor.
 When I finally reached a supervisor, I authorized my husband to continue the conversation. The
 supervisor refused to identify himself by name to my husband, and when my husband explained the
 issue and asked that we be made whole, the supervisor responded that two months would be the
 maximum refund they would offer and stated that it is our responsibility to verify the correctness of
 their billing practices.
 We have been on an automatic payment plan with Comcast for several years, and never noticed a
 significant enough change to warrant further investigation, hence our failure to review the bill
 thoroughly. However, we have always expected Comcast to act in good faith and bill us only for
 services that were provided, and not for those services they have not provided.
 Also, in reviewing their bill dated 4/21/2015 (see attached), I believe that their billing statements are
 intentionally deceptive. On page 1, the bill states that we pay $76.95 for our service and $0.70 in
 taxes for a total of $77.65. If I were to review my bill, I would see that page and assume that $76.95 is
 the cost of the cable internet service only. However, when I review the second page, that service total
 is $66.95 for the service itself and $10 for the modem rental. It stands to reason that reasonable
 individuals who review their bill on a regular basis might easily miss a charge such as this.
 Additionally, we note that their refund of $6.45 per month falls far short of the $10 that has been
 billed. At 66 months, $6.45 per month would amount to an overpayment of $425.70; $10 amounts to
 $660. The difference is very material to the average consumer.
 Please take action on this complaint and ask Comcast to make us whole. We aren't seeking anything
 more than we have overpaid them over the last five-and-a-half years, only the excess amount paid for
 services not received.
 Sincerely,
 (b) (6)",

Comcast Predatory Pricing forcing purchase of cable.,2015-06-24,Houston,Texas,77058,"Comcast prices increases bill if you remove cable from an internet plan.
 Internet individually is $75, while Internet+Cable is priced at $70. I have spent significant time with their support and get the same story: Removing Cable will increase my bill.
 Comcast does this to artificially inflate cable user accounts to get more money from cable content providers and advertisers.
 This practice not only is not intuitive to users, it is actively harming them by not giving an option to cut costs through eliminating services they are not using.
 I have no other broadband service provider in my area, so I am relying on FCC to prevent these predatory/monopolistic practices and defend me as a consumer.

Customer Service and Billing Complaint,2015-04-07,Marietta,Georgia,30068,"On Saturday, April 11, 2015, our cable/phone/internet was cut off when a Comcast service truck was next door working on a neighbor's system. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Comcast service trying to schedule a service call to give us service back. Multiple calls were made and we were told they would call us back within a few hours. Never did. We were cut off several times after being on the line for almost an hour each time. Calling back meant redoing everything from scratch. Finally, an appointment was scheduled for Monday afternoon (April 6) and this was ultimately changed to the morning of April 6th. I have no complaints about the actual service person, who did a great job. But the online chat person and the many people we spoke with were frustrating beyond belief.
 Complaint Two: We learned that our bills have been double-billing for internet service for almost two years at the tune of $55 per month. When we added voice to the package, Comcast did not adjust the billing to take off a internet access we had using another modem. The bill was not clear what was being billed in the bundle portion versus the internet access additional charge, so we were not aware of the double billing. You can't pull bills from more than about a year and one-half on the website, so it may be that we have been double-billed for even longer. I estimate that the double-billing from the point we got voice added in amounts to almost $1,000.00.
 This is apparently a common occurrence, as I have learned. That adds up to a lot of money being incorrectly billed in confusing invoices. I have registered a complaint with Comcast, but they say it's seven business days until I ever hear anything. I have asked for a copy of the report to be sent to me, but haven't gotten it yet.

 I was contacted by customer service after filing the FCC complaint. They would not refund the overbilling except for 6 months' worth. I contested that decision. It turns out that the double billing goes all the way back to 12/2012 and totals $1527.40. Here is a portion of the text from an email that I received:
 As requested, I have outlined the credits that were applied to your account for the double billed internet services dating from 12/11/2012 through 4/6/2015. The total credit that was applied to your account was in the amount of $1,527.40 and you currently have a credit balance of $1,364.31 after your current service charges of $163.09 were deducted from the credited amount. Please see attached statements as supporting documentation.
 · 12/11/2012 – 12/21/2012 = $34.63
 · 12/22/2012 – 8/21/2013 = $51.95x8 months =$415.60
 · 8/22/2013 – 8/21/2014 = $54.95x12 months = $659.40
 · 8/22/2014 – 3/21/2015 = $55.95x7 months = $391.65
 · 3/22/2015 – 4/6/2015 = $26.12
 I had to request copies of those invoices and a breakdown, both requests of which were met with less than a cooperative reply.
 Also, I would like to amend the complaint to include a new charge for onsite services of almost $100 to fix the cessation of our service caused by the Comcast repair person at the neighbor's home. This is too egregious. I have asked that these charges be taken off the bill, which does not even give a date for the service charge. The bills do not contain enough information to be able to figure out what charges are appropriate and what are not."

Comcast Incompetence/Lies/Robbery,2015-06-15,Cambridge,Massachusetts,2138,"12 days ago I called Comcast to request internet service for my new apartment. I spoke with my apartment building's ""Residential Comcast Consultant,"" Brian Leyden <brian_leyden@cable.comcast.com>. I was very clear that all I wanted was internet. No TV. No Phone. No Home Security. I just wanted internet. He says great, it will be $39.99/month for 105 mbps and drops off a internet self-install kit at my apartment complex. A few days later I attempt to activate the device with no luck so I call customer service. They inform me that the only service I've been signed up for is Basic Cable and that they're not sure how I got a wireless gateway in the first place becuase I was never signed up for internet service. I spend an hour on the phone with them while they fail to activate my service and device. Then they say they'll ship a new device to me overnight at no charge. The next day I get a bill for $175 that shows me being charged for basic cable that I never asked for, for the internet package I requested, for a $60 install service charge, and for the shipping cost of two devices, one of which is supposedly shipped overnight and the other shipped 3-5 business day speed. The device that was supposedly shipped overnight never arrived. 4 days later I get the standard shipping rate device. It doesn't work either. I call customer service again. They tell me I'll need to either go pick up a new device from a customer service center or have a tech come out for which they might charge me $50. I didn't think it was appropriate to be charged for a technician so I went to the customer service center and tried installing one last device. Of course it did not work so now I am scheduling a technician to come to my apartment and will have to fight to have fees removed after the fact. Now more than 10 days after I was promised internet service I have no service, I have wasted hours and hours of my life, and I have a series of completely nonsensical bills charging me for services, fees, and devices that I either never wanted, never received, or just plain did not work. Moreover, I have repeatedly contacted Brian to see if he can help resolve the issue and he has completely ignored me.

Comcast of East Windsor NJ Complaint,2015-05-31,East Windsor,New Jersey,8520,"I have experienced numerous internet service outages through my Comcast of East Windsor NJ

 Comcast first requires me to purchase unnecessary and unwanted services to hike up their fees. For
 example, instead of investigating why their rented router and modem equipment is not working
 properly, they require that I first purchase higher speed (blast) internet connectivity. When that fails
 to solve the technology issue, they then have refused or delayed removing the additional service from
 my account. Comcast also insists on scheduling a $75 service technician visit to ensure that my
 phone service is working, even though I do not use their phone service. I am subscribed to. 'Triple
 play' package that includes Internet, cable, and phone, but have explained numerous times that I use
 Comcast only for Internet and cable. Despite this the company insists on charging a $75 phone
 repair visit before they will proceed to. Insider my actual problem, which related only to chronic
 Internet service outages. This problem has not been resolved in over 2 months of repeated phone
 calls to Comcast billing, customer service, and advanced technical support. Their Security Assurance

 Follow-up message on 6/20/2015 11:41:43 PM:
 Dear FCC Representative,
 I am writing to request a meeting with an FCC investigator regarding the complaint referenced below.
 I have been contacted by a Comcast head office official, however I find that the remedy offered to me
 is wholly unsatisfactory as of June 20th. For several months I was left without working internet
 service, and in response Comcast offered no more than a $12 refund of an extraneous fee. I had
 requested a replacement router / modem (which was proven to be the correct solution to my service
 problem) and was denied the ability to receive such a replacement. During this time I paid
 approximately $540 in service fees and encountered nearly 50 percent downtime.
 Furthermore, I believe that Comcast's practice of attempting to forced customers to purchase high
 speed 'blast' internet service was inappropriate for someone who complained about chronic outages
 but never once indicated that slow speed was at issue. I am therefore asking the FCC to conduct a
 class action investigation to better understand whether this is a systemic problem in Comcast's Call
 (b) (6)
 Center procedures and training that affects the entire class of customers who presently use their
 basic 'high speed' internet service package.
 I can be reached at to provide additional details and clarification. Suffice it to say that
 Comcast has d one its utmost to minimize this complaint by not even acknowledging the nearly 3
 months of failure in resolving the problem. Instead they have chosen to count only the time from
 which their head office became involved during the past few weeks.
 I appreciate your help in this matter and reiterate that Comcast has not resolved this issue, despite
 what I expect them to report to the FCC to try to sweep this under the rug and avoid further regulatory
 scrutiny.

Comcast Data Cap,2015-06-29,Lawrenceville,Georgia,30045,"I received a call from Comcast that I have reached my data cap and will be charge $10 per 50g for overage. I found this ridiculous since I don't watch TV and only use the internet. What Comcast is doing is finding a way of charging us consumers who do not want to purchase unnecessary tv packages. What is the government going to do to stop companies like Comcast from charging data overage.

Comcast Billing Issues,2015-05-05,Nashville,Tennessee,37212,"Consumer is having billing issues with Comcast (internet). She has been charged by Comcast for
 things she was told she would not be charged for. Comcast did see then that there was a note saying
 she would get charged. That issue was resolved. In February 2015 she cancelled all services and
 turned in the equipment a few days later. She then ordered the most basic internet package for
 $34.99 per month or $29.99 per month if she did the eco bill. She went to Comcast on 02/27/2015
 and paid her bill in full. For some reason, every month now her bill is not for $34.99. Her first bill was
 for $102. She contacted Comcast and spoke to Janet in West Palm Beach on 03/18/2015 who said
 there was no balance and she actually had a credit on her account. On 04/24/2015 her service was
 disconnected for a past due bill of $102. She called Comcast again and paid $48. This
 representative assured here that everything was zeroed out and by paying the $48 it would be taken
 care off. They said it was an error on her end. The representative assured her this would not happen
 again. Her bill today was for $141, with $98 past due. Kathy from Indianapolis today said that she
 owes $141 from February. Kathy says there are no notes from last month’s call. She spends 25-40
 minutes on the phone with Comcast each month trying to resolve this. As a resolution, she would like
 to receive her bill with the correct amount, saying she owes $34.99. The bill should be the same
 every month. ***CTR359-phone***",
Comcast bait and switch,2015-05-28,Cumming,Georgia,30040,"On 05/26/2015 a representative from comcast called me and told me that they were upgrading my
 internet speed to 50MBPS and sending me a streaming device for $39.99. Today 05/28/2015 I
 received a cable box. I called comcast baffled because in no way did I agree to sign up for cable TV. I
 then asked if I could have the 50 MBPS internet and I was told comcast could not honor this price and
 that just the internet would be $49.99. I am somewhat baffled as to how comcast signed me up for
 cable TV without explicitly stating they were signing me up for cable tv. What is even more frustrated
 is that they practice unfair, dishonest, and unethical pricing given that they have a TRUE monopoly in
 my area. There is no other high speed internet service provider, so they can raise my rate and do
 whatever they please because I have no other options.",
Billing and slowing of internet,2015-06-12,Olympia,Washington,98502,"Where I live I can only access Comcast, an expensive provider that requires me to pay $60 a month, and later this year $80 a month for internet that is painstakingly slow, and will only load big name sites like Google, Netflix, Comcast, Sprint, etc. When I try to access my hometown newspaper, I can expect to wait a minute or two for the page to load, or for it to time out completely. The same goes for accessing library blogs, which is critical for me as a library and information science student. In addition, Comcast sells and tracks user information and web habits, and there is no choice to opt out, as there is no other internet provider in my area.

 First thank you for addressing my complaint so promptly. Unfortunately Comcast has not resolved my issue and I feel they are giving me the run around. When you forwarded my complaint to Comcast they called me Monday April 21, 2015 and set up an appointment for Tuesday April 22, 2015 between the hours of 5and 7 pm making a special note not to come before 6 pm so I could arrive home from work. When a Comcast technician had not arrived by 7:15 pm I called. First the Comcast Rep said that I did not have an appointment, when I explained that a Comcast rep had personally called me and set it up the rep said I cancelled it. I am so frustrated with this nonsense Comcast is a multi billion dollar company and they can't straighten out my internet and on demand service. Comcast customer service sucks! It is bad enough that I sometimes have to struggle to understand what most of their customer service reps are saying. Is there anyway you can light a fire under them? All I want is to receive the services I am paying for. In this age of technology the internet is a necessity for me and my family and we are all very inconvenienced. I have already paid an extra $50.00 to Metro PCS for a hot spot connections in order to have the internet. HELP HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!! Please Please Please you are the only one who can.

Comcast customer service,2015-06-01,Atlanta,Georgia,30329,"I recently upgraded my internet speed to"" up to"" 100 mbs. I paid 10 additional dollars per month for this privilege. My intent/cable TV bill averages ~ 140.00 per month. Service became so spotty and slow that it became almost useless. Made multiple calls to tech support, replaced my wireless access point with a new one. Ultimately Comcast came out to my apartment complex, fixed the problem and charged me 70.00 to come out.
 I called tonight to inquire as to why. I called at 6:43 PM, and was offered the option for someone to call me back in 5-7 mins rather than stay on hold. I chose this option. When there was no call, I called back at 7:08. I stayed on hold until 7:15 PM, when they called me back. I stayed on hold another 7 minutes until 7:22. I voiced my displease and asked to speak to a supervisor and was denied this opportunity. I was told I was responsible for the bill because it was my problem. I asked why it was my problem when it was their damn equipment and was chastised for using foul language. I never got to speak to a supervisor, and was told she was in Florida and could't assist me.
 I sent an email to corporate, but based on their lack of customer service, I doubt I will receive a response. Google internet can't get here fast enough. This monopoly is awful. They don't care. There needs to be competition and they need to be forced to provide the service that I am forced to pay high rates for. AT&T can't compete with their speed. They know they are the only real game in town. Therefore they are unresponsive.
 I expect relief. I shouldn't have to pay 70.00 for them to repair their system. Let alone the poor customer service and the waste of my time. Unbelievable.

comcast is changing my paper bill to ecobill without my consent,2015-04-26,Tucson,Arizona,85704,"Every few months Comcast is changing my paper bill to there echo bill causing me to be late on bill payment because I'm not aware that its due. I've spoke to there representatives 3 times about this and they say it's me doing it regardless of how many times i tell them it's not. I live in a part of Tucson AZ where only Comcast high speed internet is available. I am sure I'm not the only person this is happening to. I have already dropped there cable and phone service, but unfortunately my neighborhood is not set up for H S I through the phone company.Today i spoke with customer service supervisor Mike Id # 0913, and technical rep Julius Id #95874 before i was transferred again then line went back to home answering service. I am concerned because if I'm not changing my billing method and they don't seem to know who is either, how safe is my credit card info ?? Thank you for any help.

Comcast data caps in currently uncompetitive Nashville market,2015-06-18,Nashville,Tennessee,37211,"I thought it was important to add to the complaints regarding high data cap overage charges in areas where Comcast dominates the market. I'm regularly paying $10 to $50 a month for overages because I use Netflix, Amazon and Hulu rather than Comcast cable, and there are no higher-tier options. I've been told I could loose service altogether, and the only real competitor, A&T, does not offer a competitive service in my area. Although, thankfully, Google Fiber is coming to Nashville, I feel like Comcast is ripping me off while they still can. I'm sure this same situation will be very unfortunate for those in areas where Comcast/Verizon/AT&T will maintain their monopolies and duopolies for the near future. Thank you!

Lies and deception,2015-06-26,Homestead,Florida,33092,"On June 15 2015 I spent a large amount of time with Comcast service representatives on the subject of reducing my bill. An agreement was reached where I had to take phone service that I didn't want, but it came with a much reduce cost and similar other services like TV and internet. I received a confirmation email validating this transaction. I still have the original email copy and can easily provide this if needed.
 Suddenly two days later, I got ANOTHER email from Comcast with a completely different cost breakdown, much more expensive than what I had to begin with and objected to. Comcast refuses to honor the better deal negotiated on June 15. Since this involves internet as well as TV, I've filed this complaint also under the 'TV' heading.

ISP Charging for arbitrary data limits with overage fees,2015-06-12,Acworth,Georgia,30101,"To whom it may concern:
 I am a Comcast customer in the metro Atlanta area. This area is a test area for overage charges for using too much data with Comcast. This past month I was informed that I had reached this arbitrary limit on my data usage of 300 GB per month. They told me I could use more data, but it would cost $10.00 per 50 GB of data.
 I believe that this is unjust as we are using our internet connection for streaming TV shows and movies because we do not subscribe to cable. Comcast is in essence punishing us for not having a pay TV subscription with them.
 There was no limit before and now they are trying to slowly impose one and we are sadly the first pawns in the chess set to be taken down by Comcast's arbitrary data limits and per GB fees.

 not discussed was the fact that the newly presented offer was for a reduced rate for the 1st 12

"Xfinity corporate bullying, breach of contract",2015-05-03,Woodbridge,Virginia,22191,"In 2011 we signed a service agreement with Xfinity Comcast. This agreement is digitally signed via
 docusign. Each year Xfinity raised our rate without our consent, each year we have had to fight them
 with this contract. This year, they practically doubled our rate and continue to bully us into accepting.
 We have requested they cancel our service and we wish to take legal action against Comcast for
 breach of contract. Comcast however will not respond to our phone calls, email, or in person
 requests to either honor this contract, disconnect our service, or refund charges we did not agree to in
 our digitally signed contact. Xfinity will turn out account over to collection and our credit will be
 negatively impacted despite the fact we have asked for our service to be disconnected for the more
 than two months now. At Xfinity it is impossible to reach a real person via phone or chat, in person
 the reps are not willing to help, I have sent several emails to management which have been ignored.
 Our bill account continues to be overcharged (again despite our digitally signed service agreement).
 THis is corporate bullying at its best. Request the FCC assist us. Thank you very much for your
 help. Attached is our digitally signed contract and a copy of our recent bill which includes
 unauthorized price increases and charges for services not agreed to in our contract.",
Comcast Data Cap,2015-06-23,Mount Pleasant,South Carolina,29466,"I just hooked up internet outside Charleston, South Carolina, after moving from Austin, TX. I work as a lead software engineer at an established software company in Austin. All our environment is based out of Amazon, and in order to do work I frequently have to connect to machines, download various items, work on them, and place them back in a repository for the machines to pick up. When I called Comcast to set up service (the only provider in my area which would provide a useful enough speed to allow me to do my job), the representative assured me that there were no data caps on my connection and there were no overage charges. After being here a whopping 4 days, I learned that was not the case at all, and am being forced to limit myself to 300GB a month, as that is some arbitrary limit they have set. One database backup pulled down off of one of our servers can be about 100GB, so I will quickly have to make a choice as to whether or not performing my job is worth the $20 it will cost me to do something which is freely available in the rest of the country. The only reason I found this out was not due to their representatives, but logging in online to get emailed bills instead of paper ones. It's a sad state of affairs, and bandwidth is (nearly) free to the company, but charged via usage based-billing for no reason at all, other than a money grab.

Comcast Fraudulent Charges,2015-05-29,Vashon,Washington,98070,"Comcast has added several extra charges to my bill and changed the rate for service. They doubled
 the rate of service saying that I was on a one-year introductory offer. I made sure when I signed up
 that the price was set and it was not just an introductory offer to avoid this very issue. When I contact
 customer service and explain the issue they tell me the representative who signed me up over a year
 ago was mistaken and there's nothing they can do; I have to pay the bill. Then Comcast also adds
 extra services I did not order such as ""Speed Blast"" for my internet service and ""Xfinity TV"" service.
 Comcast is insisting that I have to pay for these services even though I have never ordered them and
 insisting I have to pay a higher rate because they will not uphold their verbal contract.
 Comcast also is not crediting my account for payments and charging me late fees even though I have
 not missed a single payment until this month (May 2015) and that is because I refuse to pay a
 fraudulent bill.",
Recent fines to AT&T and possibly...,2015-06-17,Swoyersville,Pennsylvania,18704,"Good afternoon. I just read about the recent fine handed to AT&T for the throttling of their ""unlimited"" network usage. I would like to bring Comcast up as a company that does the same thing with a user's home internet access. It's been proven that Comcast throttles your home internet services when you hit a certain uage limit and also at separate times of the day.
 For someone who uses Comcast services for mainly internet streaming of movies (Netflix), music, and childrens television, I am impacted on a constant basis. It doesn't have to do with my location either. We live in a small town in eastern PA.

Denial of Refund for Overpayment,2015-04-29,Douglasville,Georgia,30135,"I moved out of the apartment I was living at in December 2014, and proceeded to disconnect my internet-only services from Comcast I had procured for that apartment the day after I moved out.
 My billing stop date (or so I was informed during the call when I requested the disconnect) was on December 11th, 2014, one day after I moved out of the apartment.
 I made a payment to my account at Comcast on December 24th, 2014 in the amount of $20.31. I did so because the due date was the next day, and I never received an amount for the pro-rated amount for the 11 days of internet services I received in December. The pro-rated amount came to be $3.23, thus an overpayment of $17.08 occurred.
 I contacted Comcast customer service in January 2015 and requested a refund check of the overpayment amount, and was told the following (verbatim): ""Refund checks are automatically generated 30 days after a customer’s hard disconnection date, not the stop bill date. You will receive your refund in the form of a check. It typically takes 4-6 weeks for the entire process to take place."" The hard disconnect date occurs a month after the billing stop date, and I believe my hard disconnect date occurred on 1/27/15.
 To date, I have not received any check or refund, and have had multiple inquiries into the status of the refund deflected over the last 4 months.

Comcast refuses to uhold contract for 2 years phone/internet,2015-06-26,Cazadero,California,95421,"First Comcast disconnected my internet/phone without authorization , this occurred during a move. We were still charged a early termination fee of $90. As attempt to remedy the unlawful disconnect the original 2 year contract for a fixed rate of 39.99 for phone/internet services special was offered and contracted into at the new address. I was given a self install kit which turned out to be in non working condition. I spent at least 40 hours attempting to get service with Comcast employees on this faulty box. Finally a Technician who knew what they were doing was able to determine the box not working. I was asked to return box (an 3 hour commute) when I was given a new box but while attempting to get services, I was informed that unless I paid 60.00 dollars for an alleged bill form somewhere in the past that I had no prior knowledge of I could not get services on. This was going on 6 weeks of daily attempts to initiate service so I was forced to pay the amount without researching the validity of charge. A family member has a medical condition which emergency services have been needed and could not risk being without a phone any longer. The new box and the alleged 60.00 charge changed the account number twice. Both times I was assured by every Comcast employee that I spoke with that the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 was still in effect.
 I received a call from on the the Comcast employees who attempted to trick me into contracting into a different service agreement with service fees that were incrementally raised every 6 months. I CLEARLY DECLINED THIS OFFER why would I enter into a contract that was not as good as the one that I had with Comcast. f It was beginning to appear as if Comcast was attempting to break the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 contract by whatever means possible. Comcast monthly fee are paid by automatic withdraw from a account that a Payee of mine pays. She had been unable to resolve the escalating fee indicated that Comcast was not upholding the contract with me. In a trip another 3 hour commute I spoke with the Comcast employee who instituted the 2 year 39.99 month rate. HE remembered the original agreement and states the issue would be rectified in 3 days and gave me a Confirmation number reflecting such. This was after many more hours spent by me on this issue including long chart with a Supervisor who stated I just needed to go to the local office. The bill was never adjusted. The Supervisor at the local office does not respond to my emails as promised more time spent on this issue. The bill has now escalated so high that the Comcast employees have actually said I'm being ripped off for the services I'm getting. I now not only want amends with bill adjusted retroactively to reflect the contracted amount of 39.99 for 2 years and reimbursement for the overcharging but to be compensated for the extreme amount of hours spent on this issue.

Internet Speed Drops & Signal on Borderline,2015-06-18,Denver,Colorado,80219,"Hello,
 Not sure if this falls into ""Speed"" or ""Interference"" but here goes.
 I have called Comcast multiple times regarding my internet connection dropping once a day the past month and a half and more recently twice a day this past week. Prior to the internet connection dropping everything was working fine and I haven't changed anything at all but all of a sudden my modem would state that it's connected but no connection would come through (confirmed this with a Comcast Technical support representative) so Comcast sent a Technician two weeks ago.
 Everything in my house wires, modem, cables are fine which the technician explained and went to check outside. He stated that he did something (didn't explain what exactly only to send a new signal) and hoped it wouldn't happen again (now this isn't very reassuring) he seemed dumbfounded by the situation and the explanation he gave me was ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"". Now this technician is a nice guy he tried to help me out but what upset me the most is, NO, this does not happen in apartments because prior to this month and a half of internet difficulty my service was nothing but exceptional for just over a year or so that I've been with Comcast. To me ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"" is an excuse and a poor one, he shouldn't be hopeful but factual.
 Now I really did hope that would fix the issue, but guess what? I did not. At all, made things a bit worse. Internet connection started dropping now twice a day which is frustrating having to power cycle my modem twice a day when I'm in the middle of something.
 I called Comcast tech support again to explain the situation and this gentleman looked into my modem signal log/history to see what's up and saw that my signal was just at the ""borderline of coming and going connections"" so I asked him ""What can we do here to fix this?"" the tech support said ""I can't do anything on this end""
 I really want this issue fixed as soon as possible. I am also confused about it since for over a year of service I've had with Comcast my connection never dropped every day like how it's been doing for the past month and a half.

 been paying for 2 modem fee, when I only have one. I just took a look at my bill today while I was
 having issues with Comcast. I looked at my previous bills and saw I was over paying. I was set up
 under auto payment. The account is under my parents name as they cant speak and read English
 much and they dont look at the bills often. I am their daughter and today I looked at the bills online
 and opted out of Auto payment. I spoke to Comcast representative and they were rude and finally
 agreed on crediting me $50. While the payment was $10 each month for 11 months, which is $110.
 Another issue was I was paying too much and called Comcast asking for a representative when my
 deal ended and was charged $103 my internet service. That's when I contacted Comcast and got a
 discount after calling 3-4 times dealing with rude Customer Reps. I was finally given a deal for 60$
 when I was promised I would be given the same speed after I asked three -four times. I was
 reassured it would be same. That week the internet service was slow and I did a speed test it was 25
 mbps. That's when i took a look at my bill and saw they gave me the wrong plan with the wrong
 speed. I was given the internet plus 25 plan which is clearly the 25 mbps plan. I gave a call again to
 Comcast and explained their mistakes. Again i had to deal with different customer reps, they
 accepted their mistakes. Even though they accepted their mistakes, I was told i would have to pay
 $10 more for the super blast speed of 105 mbps which I was promised. After contacting several
 people at Comcast, I agreed to paying more because everything is connected to my internet. For
 example my phone plan and my tv service. I gave them a call today because the speed was still
 under 25 mbps. I went through all the steps the customer rep told me and found out it was a issue
 with my router. That's when I decided I would get a new router and a modem. Previously I was paying
 for a modem Comcast provided me. When I asked the customer rep that I would surely by given $10
 off my bill if I bought my own modem. He clearly told me no because he stated that I was using my
 own modem, when I clearly was not. When I was given a discount on my plan. The modem fee was
 taken off and it didnt appear on my bill, so i am guessing he thought I was using my own modem. I
 kept telling him 5-6 times in a nice tone. He on the other hand started yelling at me. I even told him he
 can have the Comcast people come out to my house and see the modem I am using is theirs. It
 clearly states Comcast underneath. After that he stated I could use my own and take that to the
 Comcast store and I would be given extra $10 off, so my bill would be $50 instead of $60. His name
 was Alex V. His customer rep id was alex v.
 id GNOPEN RACKET and was speaking from the PHILLIPEANS. That is when I took a look at my
 previous bills and saw I was actually paying for 2 modems. The name is Docsis 3 Leased Modem and
 formerly D3 voice equipment ( which I was told is a just a modem). When I called about this issue.
 Comcast people werent available as I called after hours, So i spoke to someone on the Chat server
 which I found on the Comcast Website. I explained to him I had been overpaying since May 2014,
 that's when I checked my bills and saw I was overcharged. He was ready to pay back the $50 credit
 which i talked about in the beginning of this complaint. I am fed up with the customer service support",
Comcast Billing,2015-06-25,Logan,Utah,84321,"Recently, I contact Comcast to see about lowering my bill as it had recently increased by about 30 dollars. After talking with them, they went over the charges and notified my of a $12 internet speed boost cost. Earlier this year my internet speeds doubled while on the Blast package and I was happy to be getting a better service for the same price. Unbeknownst and unauthorized by me, the bill was increased and this $12 fee was added after my promotion ran off. Comcast did a classic bait and switch without my approval. I am now paying $90 a month for their services because I am forced to keep a cable package to keep the price as low as possible. Without cable in my package (which I NEVER USE) the cost would be over $120 for the level of internet that I currently have. I worked with Comcast last week to lower the bill and wanted to remove the cable, but they told me my bill would be higher without Cable service. This is a joke of a service provider and they should not be increasing the charges without notice and forcing you by price manipulation to have a service you do not want, nor need.

Comcast Billing Dispute,2015-05-13,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48105,"Comcast refuses to let me cancel my internet/cable and provide proof that my service has been
 terminated. I have called 4 times (and counting hangups/discontents pushing 15 calls) and requested
 2 emails.
 I called on May the 4th 2015 to get my Comcast internet/cable canceled as I will no longer be living at
 my current residence. I will be moving for work. I do not have any of Comcast's equipment thus a
 cancellation of service should be relatively easy. When I first talked to the representative Kate, she
 attempted to make me feel bad for canceling both internet and cable. Then she told me that they
 have a system upgrade going on and they can not process my request until an hour later. Her
 supervisor (Jake employee ID:6850SR) reiterated her story about the system upgrade. Kate called
 me back to tell me that the upgrade will take until their office closes and that they will call me back the
 next day to complete the request. They never called. This is how Comcast found a way to extend the
 billing date. I was told the ending date was on May the 4th but when I called on the 5th they claimed it
 was the 5th.
 I have spoken with many representatives. Two of which have said ""I will get an email at
 confirming the cancellation within 24 hours""(both read the email address to me
 letter by letter). The last of these representatives being Tamika (?) (Employee ID 1361) from the
 retention department. I have received no such email (not even in my spam folder).
 As of May 13th Comcast's telephone tree disconnects me right before talking to an agent. I am
 contacting the FCC in the hopes that they can help resolve this dispute. Furthermore, I hope this
 indicates what poor customer service Comcast continues to have despite their claims to try to get
 better. Thank you fro your attention to this matter.

Inability to get service transferred,2015-06-17,Valparaiso,Indiana,46383,"First call on 6/8 was told by Comcast customer rep that I would be able to self install my modem, that their signal was active in my house. Was unable to get the modem working when called in the next day to activate. Tried all 3 modem ports in my house without success. Called Friday 6/19 and once again told that should work but they would be sending out someone to check and get things working. Called Saturday to verify that someone was coming out and was passed around from customer service to the Billing Dept to a rep who said that they would get the service established, but that my problem was that I was on their 19.99 intro offer and that the only way I could keep my internet was to sign up for the next tier of service at 24.99. I told them that I was promised the 19.99 rate for 12 months and that this was ridiculous. Finally after a 10 minute wait on hold I was told they would give me a one time lump sum credit on my bill to compensate for the extra cost of the higher tier service $60.00-why it wasn't $30 I have no idea) Meanwhile no one from Comcast ever came out to my residence to check out why I had no service. Called again on Monday 6/15-one more round of trying the different ports in the house, with no internet activity showing on the modem. Called Tuesday spoke with a rep who said that they hadn't had anyone in my house since 2012 and because of this I would have to have a service call that would cost at a minimum $59.00 rewire the service from outside to inside, although all the previous calls said that I had service in my home. I called again today to see if, like all the other calls, the story had changed, but the rep I talked to confirmed that a service call had been scheduled. On the other hand I'm not inclined to be certain that the 59.00 service call is even necessary given Comcast's absolute certainty that I had a signal and could to a self install. Also, I had asked that they email me with the particulars of what they were promising, but I had received nothing but a billing statement. To their credit , Comcast's bill reflected the promised $60.00 credit, but it was reported as an Xfinity TV line item.

Internet Speeds Not as Advertised,2015-05-12,Chicago,Illinois,60622,"I started a 25mbps internet plan with Comcast Xfinity two months ago, and at the time, I wasn't
 notified that they would throttle my speeds based on my modem. I talked to the rep extensively, and
 this was never mentioned. This is also a modem I've used previously with Comcast and has delivered
 the speeds advertised.
 Flash forward, after two months of DL speeds at 15mbps, I chatted customer service to ask why it
 was so slow. They said that it's because of my DOCSIS 2.0 modem. This particular modem is rated
 up to 38mbps, much more than the 25mbps speeds I'm paying for.
 If this is the case, why doesn't Comcast Xfinity tell consumers before they sign up for a plan?
 Additionally, why can't they deliver speeds they advertise to modems that are more than capable of
 getting that speed?",
Comcast throttling download speed.,2015-06-27,Boulder,Colorado,80305,"We are are currently paying for 50 Mbps internet speed through Comcast cable, but the actual speed has been very slow lately. I just ran an internet speed test, and was getting less than 1Mbps download speed, despite getting 11 Mbps upload speed.

Comcast data caps are an end-run around Net Neutrality,2015-05-27,Radcliff,Kentucky,40160,"In several markets (including Central Kentucky, where I live), Comcast has imposed a monthly data
 cap of 300gb. While that may seem a generous amount, it's paltry given the rise of services such as
 Netflix, Hulu, etc. Also, OS updates are becoming larger and larger all the time, and many
 applications are now delivered via the Internet in lieu of physical media. However, the filesizes have
 only continued to grow.
 Some quick math shows that to reach 300gb in a 30 day period, one would only need to use
 approximately 2.8mbps for 8 hours per day (a not uncommon thing for many households or
 businesses). This is far slower than what most Comcast plans are capable of (usually 20-50mbps).
 The issue comes into stark focus when looking at the amount of data used by Netflix. According to
 Netflix, a typical HD stream consumes about 3 gigabytes of data per hour. This means that if one
 were to use Netflix or a similar streaming video service, they would be forced to limit their viewing to
 one hour per day to stay within the 300 gigabyte limit.
 So while Comcast claims they are not throttling streaming video services, they are doing the next best
 thing, and capping data allowances to prevent users from replacing cable TV services with more
 convenient offerings.
 Comcast will claim the usage caps are to ""prevent abuse."" However, 3gb per hour comes to roughly
 7mbps, wich is roughly 1/3 of the available throughput of their 20mbps offering, or 14% of their
 ""Blast!"" offering, which is advertised as ""up to 50mbps"".
 Clearly this is an end-run around Net Neutrality rules, as any service not capable of sustaining 1/3 or
 less of the advertised speed is poorly planned and means they are trying to shift the blame onto
 consumers.
 As technology progresses, bandwidth gets cheaper and cheaper. What's more, while the throughput
 may be limited, the information itself is NOT. If I leave my 1/3 of the way open, I'm using a finite
 resource. If I'm using 1/3 of my advertised Internet speed, the Internet won't ""dry up"" like a reservoir
 will. Data caps are purely a way to extort more money from people who have the temerity to actually
 use what they are being sold.
 I urge you to use all means possible to ensure Comcast halts this anti-competitive, anti-consumer
 practice, and replace it with proper network management that only punishes those who deliberately
 congest the network, rather than ""leave the tap open at a drip.""",
Deceptive sales tactics,2015-05-29,Deerfield Beach,Florida,33064,"On May 15th I called Comcast to report outages in my area, affecting me and a neighbor ten houses
 away. The outages lasted from one to several hours. The Comcast representative, Shirlene,
 informed a technician would be sent to the area though she had trouble understanding it was not just
 me. Shirlene provisioned my modem (I don't know what that means) as she said it had never been
 done.
 I lease my modem from Comcast and this modem is an upgrade installed on 9/9/2014 due to a
 Comcast bulletin. This modem provides WIFI service as well, necessary for smartphone updates and
 tablet computer use.
 Shirlene informed me that I was eligible for a promotional speed upgrade from 25 megabits per
 second to 50 megabits per second at no additional charge as I was coming out of my current
 promotional period (quite coincidental). I made sure it would cost me no additional money per month
 and it would not affect my television Internet package at all. Shirlene assured me it would not affect
 my television Internet plan or cost me any additional money.
 As of 5/15 my smartphone and tablet could no longer connect via WIFI. I received three
 ""confirmation e-mails"" of my new service with monthly billings ranging from $180 to $275, far in
 excess of the $163 on my May 2015 billing statement.
 After posting this complaint on the Xfinity Facebook page and stating I would file complaints with my
 state's Attorney General's office, the FCC, and the FTC, Comcast scheduled an appointment on 5/28.
 The technician and eventually his supervisor were here for 3.5 hours. Xfinity informed that the
 excess billing was due to Shirlene adding telephone service to my monthly plan which I did not
 authorize.
 The entire episode was a waste of my time in having to dedicate one-half day plus to trying to
 uncover the cryptic nature of the Comcast ""confirmation e-mails"" and why I was being charged so
 much and to discover the deception in my being slammed with a service I never requested.
 To-date I don't know if the fourth ""confirmation e-mail"" from Comcast of the ""final"" billing amount will
 be applied going forward, or how long it will last, but the promotional period as Shirlene promised me
 was 24 months and only 12 months is indicated in this confirmation e-mail...another deception.",
Unauthorized charge on comcast bill,2015-04-22,Knoxville,Tennessee,37920,"Recently I took time to look at my Comcast bill. I found an unauthorized charge for internal wiring that comes to about $5 a month. I decided to go ask in person that it be removed and a refund given back to when the charge was first added and I don't even know for sure when that occurred. I auto pay my bill each month and I check the bill every couple of months or so to make sure they haven't gone up. I went to the local service center instead of calling after my last Comcast issue when I could not get help through the call center successfully. The last trip to the service center to get the issue resolved resulted in a 6 month $20 reduction in my Comcast bill but I continued to pay at the regular amount. I have $120.00 dollar overage as a result on my account. The first thing the young boy told me today (4/21/2015) was that I had already been given credit and I told him no the overage on my account was from my paying extra on my bill each month. He went on to tell me that I should check my bill more often and he could take off this month's unauthorized charge but could not credit me with any additional money but he told me I would be better off to call the call center and have them do it. He would need to leave the charge on my bill because otherwise they wouldn't refund me and in the end did not remove the unauthorized charge on this month's bill or change my account to remove it in the future. He refused to listen to anything I had to say including my issues with the call center where I was routinely switched to India. He further told me that he was sure that my attitude wasn't personal and I assure you I wasn't screaming or using curse words during this ""conversation"". I am beyond frustrated with Comcast. This is not the first billing issue we have had with them. The last time one of their salesmen showed up at the house and my mother and brother both told him that I make the decisions about the Comcast bill and he would have to talk to me. The next bill we received had cable tv added and a slower internet package added. We tried to call the ""call center"" and was told that the only person who was authorized to change the account was my father. He had been dead for over 3 years by that time. My mother and I had to take his death certificate and go to the service center to get the account changed back. We had tried to change it the time of his death but we were told my mother would lose her email if we changed it into her name. The other billing incident included charging me for a modem rental. I own my own modem and have never rented from them. It took some doing but I was finally able to get that removed. I can attached a copy of my latest bill if necessary.
 Thank you,

comcast billing increase,2015-04-04,Plantation,Florida,33322,"On June 23, 2014, I negotiated with Comcast a monthly fee of $66.84 that was to be good for 1 year from that date..

Was liked to about the speed and the price that was offered to me.,2015-06-29,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,19103,"I recently moved to Philadelphia, PA and before moving I called comcast to sign up for their Internet package that gives 25mbps download speed. I was informed by a customer service agent named Tracy that this speed will be upgraded to 75mbps for free in my area on July 15th. On June 29th, after moving to my new apartment, while activating my modem, I was informed by Comcast this was not the case. They told me that I was misinformed. To me this is as unfair business practice as I was basically lied to about the service in order to get me as a customer. To apologize, they are giving me the upgrade to 105mbps service for free (called Blast-a $12 value) for the first month. However for rest of the year to receive the service I will have to pay the $39.99 for my standard service + $12 for the Blast boost. Since I was originally told I will be receiving at least 75mbps for my $39.99, I expect at least that much (the call with Tracy was recorded as I was told that it was being recorded for quality assurance). I think it is unfair to lie to a consumer to receive their business. I hope to receive at least 75mbps for 39.99 as I was originally promised.

Comcast Internet Billing,2015-06-25,East Brunswick,New Jersey,8816,Postal Mail Ticket Ready For Data Entry,
Data Caps Discourage Commerce,2015-06-04,Madison,Tennessee,37115,"Hello,
 I am a Tennessee resident who has been effected by Comcast's Data Cap trails. The Data Cap imposed in my area is 300GB/mo. As a consumer in the digital age, a great deal of my purchases are provided to me via download or streaming service. Like many, my household regularly uses streaming services like Netflix and Amazone Prime. In my home, several devices require internet access and data usage to all sorts of media. Among these are a number of gaming systems whose online access subscriptions come with free games twice a month. Yesterday, I downloaded two of the eight games available this month and have now already used 52GB of the 300GB/mo allotment. Many other games available for digital purchase would require much larger downloads, marking a significant sector of commerce impacted by Data Caps. This is but one example, but the same could be applied to video purchases, software, and the ever increasing need for data transfer in business and our modern world as a whole. Though I pay a monthly cost to receive a consistant 50Mbps, the 300GB/mo usage limit imposed in my area means I can only use 50Mbps for approx. 13.33 hours or average less than 1Mbps over the course of said month. That is, Comcast's Data Cap discourages me from using more than 2% of the service I have purchased with a threat of penalty if I do. Comcast is billing their customers simultaniously under two pay models - double dipping if you will - in a way that discourages free commerce. Furthermore, Data Caps in general are simply incompatible with the broader marketplace of our era, as such a practice will inevitably be ever behind practical usage. I ask for Data Caps be done away with on the grounds that it is harmful to consumers and business alike, so that broadband companies imposing these then be encouraged to develop monetization models that will promote a thriving market.
 Additionally, it is apparent that broadband companies are imposing data caps to keep customers from streaming content as an anti-competitive measure to preserve their antiquated business model, and they are currenty able to do this because local ISPs have no real competition.
 Please read this article for a more detailed analysis of the practice of ISP Data Caps: http://unbreak-it.com/2014/08/data-cap-problem/
 I thank you for your time and consideration and ask that you please protect the consumer and help America thrive in a growing world economy by eliminating the practice of broadband company Data Caps.

Comcast data cap,2015-05-19,Atlanta,Georgia,30305,"Hello,
 I'm here to file a complaint due to the 350GB data cap Comcast has enforced in Atlanta Georgia. With
 a $10 overage charge for every 50GB used after. Due to the cap I've had to limit using internet
 streaming services. I've discontinued my accounts with Netflix, WWE Network, Hulu, and also
 Crunchy Roll. With all services offering HD contact having a cap of that size is ludicrous. I would like

Comcast customer service agents lie about offers to switch,2015-06-13,Indianapolis,Indiana,46234,"Today I called Comcast customer service to find out the procedure to install my own cable modem.
 The first agent said that she could help me but obviously after a few minutes I could tell she did not know what she was talking about, so I requested that she transfer me to someone knowledgeable about this issue, SHE HUNG UP!
 When I called back in, I again asked to speak to someone who could give me info on what I needed to do to install my own modem. At this point, the agent does not offer information about the modem but instead tells me that she can make me an offer to lower my bill which she tells me is due to go up by $30 per month on the next statement. She proceeds to tell me that she can offer me the same internet and cable service I now have plus add telephone service and reduce my bill to $108 per month total including taxes if I agree to a 1 year contract. Since I am presently paying $130 and according to her I will be raised another $30 per month on my next statement, I am a little skeptical about the offer. So I ask her at least 2 or 3 more times to verify the $108 per month rate and also the fact that my current plan will not change. Every time she confirms these terms! So I agree to go ahead. She keeps me on hold for 10-15 while she gets things approved. After around 35 minutes I am disconnected, and she never calls me back.
 Later this evening I am watching TV and notice that my current channel lineup has been changed and I no longer have the ""preferred"" channels that I had earlier today. Once again I have to call and go through the whole BS security process to get to speak to someone. I am then informed that my plan has been switched to a lesser package. THE PREVIOUS CS AGENT FLAT OUT LIED TO ME TO GET ME TO AGREE TO THE NEW 1 YEAR CONTRACT WITH A LESSER PACKAGE!!
 I said that I needed to speak to a supervisor or I was going to cancel my service. The agent said that the supervisor was busy and she would have him call me back, that was and hour and a half ago, NO CALL BACK, ITS NOW 10PM.
 So my service has now been downgraded to a lesser package despite the fact that my service is paid for another 3 weeks. And each time you contact Comcast you have to speak to a different person and explain all over again what has happened.

Intermittent poor service,2015-06-23,Marlborough,Connecticut,6447,"I've been having problems with Comcast internet service for months. I've had many requests for assistance through their call in center, phone application, and in person. I've restarted, reinstalled, cleaned cables, followed every troubleshooting process. There are no other service providers in the area. I exchanged the router/modem for a new one, and am still experiencing the same issues where the internet will be ""connected"" but no uploading or downloading for several times a day for periods of up to an hour. Comcast refuses to credit for down time, they will not address the issue at all, their only assistance has been that I need to upgrade to a premium package. With the new modem, it has been broadcasting a separate connection named ""xfinitywifi"" which is not connectable by me, I've asked to have it discontinued as it slows down my already weak transfer of information but it continues to broadcast secondary wifi connections.

Comcast Internet Only Service,2015-06-25,El Cerrito,California,94530,"I signed up for a $39.99 plan in April 2015, and in June 2015, a Comcast sales rep asked me to try their Double Play (adding TV), stating I have 30 days to change my mind and return the self install kit. I never hooked up the TV receiver and just returned the equipment. Now Comcast says I'm no longer eligible for the original plan (supposed to be valid 12 months) and must pay $66.95 for the same Internet only plan. I asked to be reinstated to the same original plan I signed up for in April and they claim it's ""not available"" because now I'm an existing customer and not a ""New customer"" The reps and their so called retention department conveniently forgot to mention this when trying to sign me up for Double Play and then cancelling the Double Play. This is a very sleazy way to get me off the original relatively low cost Internet only plan...please see the attached ""One Time Charges"" where they are billing me for Double Play that I never used, and at the higher monthly rate for the Internet Only service.

Comcast internet service,2015-04-14,Salem,Massachusetts,1970,"For approximately 1 week (~29 Mar 15 - 3 Apr 15), my internet connection (as well as television) repeatedly lost connectivity. This was not isolated to my home or an internal issue - the Xfinity app indicated that there was an outage in my area each time and that it was being worked on.
 It became very difficult to work remotely, either by using my VPN for telework or my VOIP telephone to connect to conference calls.
 I reached out to Comcast over social media (Twitter - @ComcastCares, which is an amusing handle for a company which clearly does not) twice during the week, and received no response either time, which only served to further aggravate me.
 The last thing we need is for Comcast to become even larger and have even less competition than currently exists. In my area, Comcast is the only high-speed internet provider available if one uses the 25mbps+ definition and excludes poor substitutes (i.e. satellite). Verizon is the only other wired provider, but they currently won't even sell DSL to my location (which is downtown). They used to, at speeds up to 3 or possibly 6mpbs - in other words, practically useless. Comcast needs to focus on properly serving existing customers and providing services for which those customers have paid.
 I am attaching screenshots of one outage from the Xfinity app.

"Comcast theft, lying, horrible service and deception",2015-04-02,Portland,Oregon,97229,"After having internet service with comcast and receiving sub par service my fiancee and I decided when we moved we were switching to another company. Upon calling Comcast they offered us a retention offer and we decided to add cable on with the offer they quoted us at. Adding cable required a security deposit for the cable box so we paid that. A week later we notice there's still no service at our new address and I called comcast to see what's going on and find out that they closed our account down completely after taking our deposit. After hours of being shuffled on to other departments, and having to call back because departments were closed that they transferred me to I finally get a call back scheduled for the next morning at 9am. That call back never happened so after hours of re explaining what was going on Comcast then tells me the package I was offered doesn't exist and that the order was put in for a different package. They then told me I can either live with the other package at a higher rate or have nothing at all. They had no problem charging me the deposit but not only do they shut off my service afterwards but they also tell me the package is no available at all. That's theft, fraud, deception and they're lack of caring or owning up to anything is ridiculous. My fiancee works from home and we now have no service which amounts to lost pay. So there's also consequential damages. Would like to add that Stacey from the beaverton, Oregon location is the only person I spoke to with any sense. Not using that as a jab at the others, but if all of the comcast agents were like her, then this complaint would have been completely avoided.

I get passed around department to department like trash. I wish i could switch services but there is no other options in my area for high speed internet. I feel trapped in a monopoly. Please someone help me. I just want fair service from a principle based company and Comcast apparently has no principles

Throttling by Comcast/Xfinity,2015-06-14,Hanover,Pennsylvania,17331,"I continue to not receive the advertised speeds that Comcast spouts in their ads. Now I understand network issues etc, I should be receiving those speeds or at least within certain parameters. I am not.
 I've asked for help and paid for their ""techs"" to come out and tell me there is nothing wrong. On the possibility that my equipment was a problem I've purchased new a Arris/Motorola modem to handle the speeds I'm paying for, a Apple Airport Extreme router, several new switches to connect all devices, new cabling for my brand new desktop, Apple Retina 5K 27inch iMac.
 I pay for the top tier speed available in my area and only once in a while do I see those speeds. Of course registering a complaint with the FCC I'm fearful that my service will start to suffer from mysterious outages and other issues.
 There is no watchdog group we can complain to or even pay someone to come out and verify speeds etc. Maybe you guys can help out.

"Bill issues, Internet and disability comcast prices",2015-06-23,Gaithersburg,Maryland,20878,"I have been a loyal long term customer with Comcast and very upset that I would have to deal with such instances of poor customer service. Once again, this is very upsetting to me that I would experience such poor customer service from Comcast especially after I just had major surgery in June 2015. I informed Comcast that I am disabled since October 28, 2014 and never adjusted my bill which my income had decreased, it matters about the increase of my monthly bill since a disabled person can’t get any assistance in this matter. In May before my surgery, I had an issue with the price which was $114.88 then $24.42 for approximately three months March to May and June it rise up to $39.85 and I was informed by Comcast customer representative to call the Franchise in Montgomery County. This was totally unacceptable because if I have a question about a price I should be able to get that information from a Comcast representative. Secondly, to obtain phone records, I went through a lot to obtain that information. Stacey, executive customer care who never been helpful to me states that she can’t give that information. I have a right to my phone information and being a persistent customer I finally got that information with no problem. In addition, Comcast tech comes to my house totally disrespect me in my home in front of guest only to answer my guest question about her cable and didn’t assist me with my cable internet which I called for tech service. That same evening I had to call Comcast technical service they helped me over the phone with my internet service. As I complained about these issues, Stacey Executive customer care have not been helpful but give me several excuses why not to help me with no resolutions which I continued to complain to receive satisfactory results. I am still having problems with my internet that is slow or cut off which I calls technical service rapidly.
 Now my bill is $139.85, I called customer service to find out what happen. The customer service rep told me that I received a loyalty discount which I never informed as he continued he couldn’t answer my question. I requested a supervisor and Dennis (Supervisor) called me back with a sarcastic attitude that Comcast made a mistake on the prices that my price $139.85 had always been the price I always had. I asked so why I am being targeted about the mistake, I was very upset with his sarcastic told telling me any answers that he thought would be satisfactory. Now Comcast is raising my service to repay back for their mistake is unacceptable, this is what was told to me by the customer care supervisor Dennis. Please listen to his tape recorded message today ticket number #02850199.",
hbo go comcast,2015-04-17,Boston,Massachusetts,2215,"I pay for my comcast cable which includes hbo, Comcast internet, and I paid for my ps3 which has an app that Sony developed to play hbo go on my tv. I presumably paid for this app as it is downloaded from Sony available to people who purchased play stations. Right now comcast doesn't let their customers use the ps3 app because of ""purely commercial decisions"" meaning there are no technical issues, they are just blocking the use of the app to their customers. I was wondering why it is ok for them to block content I pay for on a device that I paid for because (presumably) they want more money from sony?

Comcast xfinity triple play,2015-06-26,East Brunswick,New Jersey,8816,"I pay for the Comcast Triple Play and was without service for 4 days in May because a technician unplugged my line when installing another customer in my apartment building. I scheduled an appointment and my parents re arranged their work schedule to sit here and wait for a technician because my fiancé and I couldn't take the day off. My parents sat here for 6 hours and the technician never showed up. I called several times that day and then was told the technician had rescheduled the appointment without notifying me but that he would come that evening. He again did not show up and did not call. I was promised I would receive a bill credit for the days without service that I had been paying for, and two $20 credits for the missed appointments. I have called a number of times in the last month and they promise the credit in the amount of $66.03 and it doesn't appear. I have been promised a call back by a supervisor several times and no one ever calls me. All I want is the $66.03 credit I was promised. I paid for a service I didn't receive, and this has caused a huge inconvenience to me and my family. I also went over on my cellular data due to not having internet for 4 days but still needing to do things online like pay my bills. I need the credit to cover my extra cost on my cell phone bill.

internet availability for students,2015-06-01,Lake Tapps,Washington,98391,"I am Superintendent of the Dieringer School District. Out supportive community recognizes the importance of student access to technology and the integral nature of internet access for their education and, ultimately, their future. To this end, the community has funded 1:1 computing for our students. This has led to wonderful innovations that require students to have access to high speed internet at home. Unfortunately, internet providers are not regulated. This has allowed large companies (CenturyLink and Comcast) to take over much of the district, drive out smaller providers, and then refuse to provide service to neighborhoods that were previously served by the smaller providers. in some cases, they have left one side of the fence or one end of a street without service while providing it to other. Comcast says they will not provide service to these areas; CenturyLink says they have no plans to do so at this time. This is resulting in educational inequity for some of our students that cannot be resolved by subsidy. We cannot educate students for their future without internet access.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/17/2015 12:38:19 PM:
 Thank you for checking back. Unfortunately, we have been unable to make any progress in our effort to make internet service available to the students of our school district. As we have stated previously, our community has made a huge investment in our children’s futures by providing 1:1 computing for students 3 grade and up, high quality Cloud-based curriculum and a web-based learning management system that allows students to receive and turn in assignments, as well as collaborate with classmates online.
 When Comcast and Century Link made a big push to gain the market share, ClearWire, which had previously been an option in our community, was driven out leaving some children without access to internet. The lack of access to high speed internet denies these children access to our educational program. Interestingly, yesterday there was major news about efforts and the critical need to provide internet access to low income student in order for them to have access to the same educational opportunities that their peers with internet have. The missing part of the story is the ability of large companies, like CenturyLink and Comcast, to refuse to provide access to families on the same street and across the fence from those who have this critical access.
 We have contacted the Washington State Utility Commission, the Washington Attorney General, Senator Patty Murray and your agency. The net result, to-date, is letters from Comcast indicating they have no intention of proving services and that they have told these families that to do so, the families would have to pay up to $50,000 to extend cable down the street when the families at the end of the street and across the fence did not pay for the access to their homes.
 If companies will not be responsible, and no agency has the ability to develop plans for internet coverage, then the system is lacking an important piece of oversight. Please advise us as to any next steps in our effort to provide equity of access to all our students and not leave unserved pockets of children behind.
 Regards,
 Superintendent, Dieringer School District

Comcast overcharges for internet charges,2015-05-30,Powder Springs,Georgia,30127,"On April 30th 2015. I went over my allotment of my internet bandwidth. This was my second outage
 charge for the Month of April. Since its was the last day of the month, I download a large amount of
 data before 10pm EST on April 30th. My bill cycle rolls over at the end of the month so when I logged
 in to my Account May 1st at 8:00am EST . I was shock to see that I was ding for 20GB of data usage
 from the day before. I received my bill and it showed that they charge me the extra 50GB twice for
 the month of April. Called Comcast got past around and in the hour was told it is what it. They can't
 tell my why the system recorded the data usage from April 30th on May 1st Cycle because they have
 no way of telling when the usage occurred even though they can up data my usage every 45 mins. I
 do not mind paying for the overcharges that I use, but when I go over the last day of the billing cycle
 and get charged for another 10 dollars for another 50GB block. I should be able to used as much of
 that 50GB before my billing cycle rolls over to May 1st, instead they rolled my usage over to May 1st

Data Cap,2015-06-25,Olive Branch,Mississippi,38654,"The Comcast data cap is extremely unreasonable. A 300 gig limit each month in this day and age where more people are choosing to forego cable and satellite in favor of internet based streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. 2 people in a single household can eat that up if each watches just 2 hours a day. Television subscription services do not impose such a limit, so why should internet entertainment be subject to such an issue? Data is not in a limited supply. It is simply a method for Comcast to milk money from consumers who have no other options in their area since Comcast has ran out competition or bought them out.
 I feel that this issue desperately needs to be addressed. Consumers have zero choice in the matter. Even the option of paying extra each month for an increased data cap would be a slight improvement. Although the optimal option would be a return to the days of no cap. Please do all you can to discuss and or address this data cap issue.

Faulty Service and False Advertisement,2015-06-24,Chicago,Illinois,60607,"On June 24, 2015, I contracted with Comcast Xfinity internet for a $19.99 a month package for 3 mbps.

Comcast Billing / Speed Issues,2015-06-24,Broomfield,Colorado,80020,"I have had a 105 Mps plan from Comcast for $34.99 per month in Broomfield, CO. In May, Comcast raised my rate to over $80 per month with absolutely no warning or notice (I was specifically told when I was opening my account that I would have plenty of notice before any price increase) . Since I do not have any need for Cable TV or Phone services, I was told that my only option was paying over $55 per month for a slower internet only plan. After saying I will be canceling my service and switching providers, a manager was able to offer a slower internet only package at 50 Mps, at a rate of $44.99 per month.
 Now, ever since I switched to a lower speed plan, I rarely receive the advertised rates I pay for (consistently see speeds averaging 12/Mps), and am paying $10 more per month for half the speed I used to get (from 105 Mps to 50 Mps).

 Hello,
 I would like to add additional information regarding our Comcast account. We had a Comcast technician stop by on 6/25/2015 to try and diagnose the issues behind our very low speeds (12Mbps average - paying for 50Mbps). He was not able to find any issues, and during his visit, we were receiving the full 50+Mbps. Only a couple of hours later, our speeds dropped drastically back down to 10-12 Mbps - http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/941730544.png. I am not sure if our speeds are consistently being throttled, but ever since we were forced to switch plans, we rarely see over 20% of the speeds promised.
 We have tried everything, however Comcast is not willing to resolve the issue. We went from paying $34.99 a month for 105Mbps, to paying $45 a month for 50Mbps and only receiving an average of 12Mbps.
 All the best, (b) (6)

Over Charged for Service Never Received,2015-06-26,St. Augustine,Florida,32080,"I was talked into upgrading my service to include home phone because it would be less expensive than the same level of internet and cable service without phone.

I let the sales rep know that I owned my own modem and didn't want to receive a phone capable modem, also told that wasn't a problem. Made the service change in September 2014, checked the next bill and it was fine. Starting in November I began being charged for a modem but didn't realize it for a few months. Once I found out about the error I made several attempts to reach someone that could fix the issue giving up after wait times in excess of 30 minutes per call. Comcast allows you to add or upgrade service with the click of a mouse, answers the upgrade line with little to no wait time 24 hrs a day, and even provides on-line chat windows to upgrade or add. When I finally toughed it out I was told that they could only refund 60 days worth of charges per company policy. I waited an excessive amount of time to speak to a supervisor that told me the best he could do was $40 credit on my next bill. Supervisor was Michael at approximately 9:30 pm 6/26/15. Total length of time for call was over 35 minutes. I have also had my service disconnected 1-2 days before the disconnect date indicated on the notice sent in the mail on multiple occasions. Comcast uses its virtual monopoly to suck money out of the pockets of its reluctant customers with unscrupulous business practices.

Cruel and Illegal Practices - Comcast,2015-06-23,Cordova,Tennessee,38016,"Originally when we moved to Memphis, TN from our previous residence we signed a contract with Comcast for 105Mbps Internet (no data cap). It was expensive but justifiably useful. Our household has a family of 5, all heavily connected to the internet be it for work, school or leisure. Modern high-school and college courses require mandatory streaming of supplementary lectures online, the download and upload of large assignments (from film to engineering projects), download and sharing of books/notes and more. We were shocked when Comcast upped our monthly bill in 2013 and instituted mandatory data caps with no option for us as a consumer to pay more to avoid caps (instituting usage based billing on a renewable resource). 300GB a month is an impossibly small amount of data for the average family to survive on and directly impacts how we utilize our 105Mbps of data. Please stick with me while I explain.
 Comcast is allowed to sell us 105Mbps of data-rate a month but footnote a cap. Bandwidth is a measurement over time, something not used in a moment of time is effectively wasted.
 105Mbps with a mandatory cap of 300GB a month means theoretically Comcast is selling us about 7-8 hours of internet a month. They should not be allowed to misrepresent 8 hours of maximum theoretical internet time as 105Mbps of data transfer speeds per month at the price they quote me. This is obviously not a realistic number as generally we have about 50% real-world overhead for LAN with no bottlenecks. So we'll say 12 hours of data a month.
 Now just assuming the above alone we are also being charged for the 10% of overhead all internet processes are subjected to (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Nagle/summary.html) which is actually part of the Official Protocol Standards (STD 1: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2001.html) but our bill does not reflect a 10% grace, we are charged for physical limitations of reality.
 Frankly though, no one will ever agree to accurately advertising your service in this objective manner so I pose a more logical alternative.
 If one has a 300GB data cap, and is purchasing internet, the ISP should be barred from referencing these false data rates.
 300GB a month is 300GB divided by 30 days = 10 divided by 24 hours = .41667 divided by 60 minutes = .0069444 divided by 60 seconds = about 116KBps.
 Comcast is illegally calling my 105Mbps package broadband when in reality (per usage based billing) I am only receiving 116KBps monthly allowance at a sustained 24/hour usage (remember, bandwidth is a measurement over time, so they cannot assume I'm not using the data 24/7 in an advertisement).
 116KBps is not broadband as classified by the FCC. It isn't even close, and based on my monthly bill it should be downright illegal. I don't have any options for Broadband where I live. Comcast is allegedly the only one in my area. But math does not lie, and proves that they are wrongfully advertising what I pay for (105Mbps/300GB) as broadband when any rational state-educated human can see this is not the case.
 Comcast claims the data cap is only for Memphis as well, that is what it says in my contract, but I live in Cordova and am still subjected to this malicious and downright criminal practice. I plan to also file advertising complaints with the FTC for this as well.
 Please FCC, bar ISPs from being able to call capped plans ""broadband"" and require by law accurate description of what the customer is purchasing much like in the AOL days when you purchased ""hours"" of internet because that is effectively what Comcast is selling me.
 The only ethical and moral thing to do is advertise as theoretical hour usage per month (which will turn away all customers) or truthful bandwidth per month based on the cap you pay for (in my case 116KBps).
 Networks should never be allowed to cap it as a resource like oil. Quality of service management like peak hour throttling is more than reasonable but data caps are stifling innovation and bleeding the American family dry. Don't let them pillage what the United Nations called a ""universal human right.""
 Can you imagine an America where the FTC allows the auto industry to sell a car capable of 40MPG but only the car can only travel 40 miles a month, and the rest of the month the car has to sit in the garage or the driver is charged exorbitant fees to travel.
 Please FCC, do the right thing. Help us out from under this data cap or at least force Comcast to adjust our billing based on the REAL data transfer speed they sell us, 116KBps.

Internet Speed Cut in Half with no Notification,2015-06-23,Stevensville,Michigan,49127,"About a month ago, I called Comcast to remove a continuous $10 charge for Blast because I felt it was unnecessary. The last time I had read about their ""Blast"" service, it said that it only sped up the first very small portion of a download, (25mb if I recall correctly). Thus I felt it was unnecessary, so I wanted to stop paying $10 extra a month for it. Fast forward to almost a week ago, I started noticing my download speeds were almost half of what they were before. I attributed it to bad weather or technical difficulties of some sort. I kept doing speed tests multiple times daily, each time showing me results of 25-29mbps download, 4-6mbps upload speeds. When I started my service with Comcast, I had an introductory deal that gave me a cheaper price for a certain amount of time, (can't recall exactly how long), and after it was over, I would have to pay more for the same service, which was 50mbps download, 10(?)mbps upload. When the deal was over, I went from paying $54.99/mo to $86.95/mo. I was fine with the price increase, I knew it was going to happen, but I wasn't happy with the $10 extra charge. So I called to have it removed, resulting in my future bills being $76.95. After I removed the $10 extra charge, about 2 weeks ago, my internet speed was normal, up until the last week or so. Today I contacted a customer service representative and they told me I was paying for their ""Performance Package"", which is 25mbps download.
 My complaint is the fact that I had no idea my internet speed would be cut in half over a $10 charge, which I actually don't even know is the reason that caused it. I received no email, no call, no notification whatsoever that my internet speed would be dropped so drastically. I feel extremely ripped off and deceived.

internet pricing /competition,2015-04-20,Ramsey,New Jersey,7446,"Hello respected human,
 I am a resident of public housing in Ramsey new jersey,I want to know that we have no competition in internet,tv and phone service,we have been dealing with cablevision which increases there prices every year and I have no choice. I am not allowed to have a dish by housing authority,
 On top of that I am paying cable $100.00 a month without most TV channells,
 I am forced to watch cable vision ads while paying them.(matterfact i should be paid by cable company to let them advertise to consumers who is paying them. Also this how they advertise to waste there money to charge consumers more, in that sense i should not have to watch Verizon advertisement is well caz they can not provide me service here.
 Since this is the age of target advertisement why both companies are wasting millions of there ad money on me, they advertise low price packages and then cable vision tells me ,I am not there target customer ????
 Another point I want to bring to your notice CELL phone companies give you 30 day money back guarantee but we consumers don,t get the 1st bill in a month also 30 day guarantee was when they were offering contract for 1 year only now minimum contract is for 2 years ,satisfaction guarantee should be for 3 months now.
 I hope I made some valid points and consumers could benefit from it.
 Thank you
 Sincerely,
 Ramsey NJ 07446

Billed without service,2015-06-28,Denver,Colorado,80250,"I went into the service center at Belmar shopping center and spent a great deal of time discussing the different options because I was most concerned about the ability to have my TV connect wirelessly. The prepresentative at Comcast went into great detail about how their modem would be better and faster than my current provider Century Link. I decided to take the modem home and try it contingent on the representative stating to me directly that I could return the modem if I didn't use the service and would not be charged a penny. I told the representative that Century Link was going to increase the speed of my internet and that if it didn't work I would use Comcast. I took the modem home but I NEVER used it. I never used my Comcast for one single moment. I went into the Comcast center because they were billing me and the representative told me that a manager would call me because he wasn't able to take my modem back and issue a credit. He also told me that Comcast could not check if I ever used the service. When I asked for a manager the representative in the store told me that one was not available and it was mid day. I insisted that someone address the issue and he told me that a manager would contact me. A manager NEVER contacted me. Then Comcast had a third party service named Complete Recovery Corporation contact me. I spoke with Steven May and told him that I never had Comcast service and I was more than happy to return the modem but I needed my account to be cleared. I made several calls to Comcast to try to correct this and went into the service center more than once. I finally gave up because a manager NEVER contacted me as promised. Then last week I discovered that Comcast has placed my account with a collection agency and the collection agency has already reported the account to the credit bureau without contacting me. I discovered this when it was brought to my attention as I was applying for credit. Comcast also placed a hard inquiry on my credit file and they never asked me or disclosed to me that they were going to check my credit. I never used the service with Comcast. I was promised I could return the modem if I never used the service and not be charged. The representative at the service center refused to allow me to talk to management. Management never called me. Comcast did not resolve the issue when I contacted them over one dozen times about this.

Unfair pricing practices,2015-06-24,Madison,Alabama,35758,"My ISP, Comcast, currently offers bundled services for phone, tv, and internet with lower internet prices than they offer standalone internet service. This is not merely as part of a promotional offer. They offer a punitive pricing schedule for standalone service. I believe this is done to help their stock performance metrics, as it allows them to demonstrate to shareholders an artificially inflated number of subscribers to all their service offerings.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate.

Comcast 300GB data cap,2015-06-24,Marietta,Georgia,30066,"I have been a Comcast customer for a number of years. I am not a gamer, I stream movies occasionally and I have not added any new internet-ready items in my home. However, in the past few months, I have noticed a substantial increase in the amount of internet usage Comcast is claiming that our house uses. I use my own modem & router & can see, at all times, what is connected to my home network. The network is password protected. I had a maximum of 9 ""clients"" (a TV, a network fax machine, 2 Directv boxes, a wi-Fi extender, 2 iPads, a BluRay player and a desktop computer) connected to the network. The only client connected at all times to the network is the wi-fi extender. the others are turned off periodically. When the internet overage issue first came up in February 2015, I was concerned. According to Comcast, My January 2015 usage increased over 150 GB when compared to the December 2014 usage. This was without adding any new internet clients. Each month has increased gradually since. I changed my internet password to ensure my network was being used externally (although I know it was not). i also removed the TV and the Fax machine from the network (making my current total of clients 7 items). The password change & the removal of 2 clients did not affect the usage at all. In fact, it seemed to increase the usage. I contacted Comcast with my concerns. they informed me that I must be using that much and suggested that I might be using a torrenting program. I asked them why they would think that & they pointed to a supposed warning I was sent in 2010 or 2011 about downloading a torrented movie. I responded that I 1) don't recall any warning and 2) I don't torrent. I will say that this increase in usage started to occur right after I negotiated a lower monthly rate for my internet usage. I realize that Comcast has a business to run but it is also my understanding that this overage program has not been implemented nationwide but only in a select few areas. I question the fairness of this overage program and certainly question their ability to accurately calculate my home's internet usage. The current month is shaping up to be the biggest month yet. I am quite disappointed.

Comcast cable,2015-04-13,Tallahassee,Florida,32317,"I initiated my account with Comcast in October of 2014. As soon as I received my first bill I had to call and address issues of charges that were not supposed to be on there. This went on for several months until January, 2015. At that time I received paperwork stating that I was past due. I was distracted and angry and paid the bill without thinking. Later that day I realized that the bill was incorrect. I called and spoke with a representative and was advised that I had indeed been over billed for past charges that were incorrect. I was advised that I was now paid up for the next cycle and would even have a credit of $5.00 or so on the bill after that. On 04/13/15 I received a new notice saying I was going to be disconnected for past due charges. Upon calling I was advised that I was improperly billed the first two months (they stated that I was not actually charged for my internet at all) and that I was now being charged accordingly. I was also told that there had been increases in both the cost of the router and my service. This is contrary to what I signed up for in October for a 12 month agreement. After complaining I was told the best they could do was a $30.00 credit. They have literally changed the fees and cost of my service and are now telling me that I can do nothing about it. I was subsequently told that I was being charged a late fee as well. When I stated that I have received no bill I was told by the representative that I had previously signed up for ebilling. I never asked for or signed up for paperless billing and have received no such bill.

Faulty Bill for More Profit,2015-06-09,Houston,Texas,77033,"To Whom It May Concern:
 Comcast bills each month for services renders. The questionable business practice of billing the customer for late payments (paid online) and then Comcast states they received a request for paperless billing when in fact no such request was presented by the customer. Next, after Comcast have received a $35 late fee for the so called last due payment, Comcast offers an option for paper billing for each months' bill mailed out. But if the customer decides not to take the offer of paperless bill then the customer is billed a late fee and an additional $1 to start paper billing. The agreement with Comcast states nothing about the interchange between paper and paperless bill until Comcast states they did not receive payment on the due date and a late fee is assessed.
 Please request Xfinity/Comcast Internet services to discontinue the practice of charging a late fee for profit when Comcast did not send a paper bill or e-mail bill until after the due date. Thanks.

Over Charge by lying,2015-06-18,Blacksburg,Virginia,24060,"Dear Sir or Madam,
 I opened Comcast's Xfinity service by calling them about two month ago. An agent told me the price was $54.99 a month and she could help me open the account. I agreed. However, they charged me $64.99 a month. I called them twice about this issue in the past two weeks. The first agent told me they would call me back. However, they never did. The second agent basically hung off the phone after I told her what happened. I think at least their agents are not honest. I felt a kind of being robbed and fooled. $10 is not a big deal. However, I do not want to be fooled in such a way. So I decided to file a complaint. I am wondering if you can help me make them set the price to the right one. In this way, I also think we can make Comcast a better company.
 Thanks,

Comcast internet-Price keeps changing,2015-04-27,Mapleton,Utah,84664,"Comcast pricing structure is a mess. I have been paying $49.99 for residential internet. $49.99 is a promotional price. My newest bill came in at $66.95 with a $3.39 service discount netting to $63.56. When I called the only option was for me to sign up for internet and cable for $69.95. That price is good for a year and they I guess it will go up and up and up. The FCC has to force these providers into utility status. Every few month I feel like I am at a street fair in Kabul haggling with a street vendor over the price of a scarf. In my location I have no other wired service options, only wireless. I find the Comcast product acceptable but having to continually negotiate pricing is absurd. I want their best deal all the time. I pay my bill like clockwork, is it too much to ask to get good stable pricing from my internet utility?

Outrageous Comcast charges,2015-06-24,Sykesville,Maryland,21784,"Over the past year and a half my cable bill has nearly doubled and slowly climbs and fluxates with increased cable box rental charges and other misc fees. If you need more of my bills please let me know and I can show the changes. For the same service from Verizon about 20 min from my house I only had to pay about $100 a month. Comcast has a monopoly in my area due to lack of internet and cable vendors.

service not disconnected as requested. overcharged and overpaid as a result.,2015-04-15,Maryland Heights,Missouri,10701,"Contacted Comcast in Jan 2015 via non-burner cell to have internet (only service I had), on Jan 31, 2015 (I have call log). My lease was up on Jan 31st. Have lease & ltr confirming move out. On February I paid what I thought was an outstanding balance but in reality was a bill including February and March charges. I did not know this at the time due to hectic relocation to NYC. During this call, agent instead of reviewing charges, status of service (should have been disconnected on 1/31), offered a ""vacation service"" so I wouldn't have to pay installation, connection and deposit once I moved to permanent apt in NYC in March. Already started working in NYC as of 1/5/15 (I have pay stub). Living in temp housing in NYC since 12/30/14 (have receipts), but kept internet in Illinois due to surveillance camera since my boxes were still there until 1/31/2015. I agreed to vacation service of $7 per month for February and March (move in date to perm apt in NYC was 3/15/15). In March I called Comcast to have service transferred from vacation service to cable and internet to NYC but was told:
 1) Comcast does not service NYC
 2) Your regular service was not actually disconnected until a month after your request in January! So Comcast charged AND collected for February regular service, February vacation service, March vacation service and partial April vacation service due to one month in advance billing.
 I have contacted Comcast 13 times (I have phone logs) re my refund but I receive a different answer every single time. Two weeks ago I was told that I had not returned the CABLE TV box but I didn't even have cable.
 As of today's date, Comcast owes me a refund of $148.50. Because of my initial temporary apt situation, I gave Comcast my sister's address in MO. I have given them this address several times. In order to avoid any further confusion, I am using that same mailing address on this complaint.

Comcast Billing & Customer Service,2015-05-20,Panama City Beach,Florida,32413,"Comcast ripped me off by stealing money from bank account without authorization. They took the
 money right after I already paid my bill. It was a ton of work to get the money back and I was given
 nothing but excuses and poor treatment. We then have a billing issue, and are being over charged for
 our services. While correcting the billing issue they change our internet services without our
 permission and then charge us more money to get the same internet back that we have always had
 and refused to offer us the same price even though it was their mistake. So we had to be charged
 more than what we were paying before COMCAST made the mistake. So we have been continuously
 mistreated, and ripped off, by this company.",
Comcast Bundles,2015-06-23,Grosse Pointe Farms,Michigan,48236,"The description of my problem is aptly captured here: http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/want%C2%AD-a-lower-comcast-bill-complain-to-the-fcc/ -- in a nutshell, I have the same issue as the gentlemen there. I cannot lower my Comcast bill. All I want is their Internet service, and yet they force me to buy a bundle that includes cable television b/c the bundle is actually cheaper at the time of purchase than just paying for Internet service. What's worse is that after 6 months, they'll claim the ""bundle promotion expired"" and raise your bill back up. This just happened to me. My bill went from around $40/mo back up to ~$60/mo. When I called to complain about it, they told me the bundle promotion was expired, and there were no new promotions. They also told me that dropping the bundle and just going with Internet service would be more expensive. This is absurd. They are the only legitimate option for Internet in my area. I have had it with them. I hope the FCC can look at this with a critical eye and see it for what it is and adjust their behavior.

"Service connection issues, increased billing, bad service, unfair trade practices",2015-06-10,Islamorada,Florida,33036,"We have been without service for over a week now. Several hours spent on phone with techs have been unsuccessful, and they insist there is a problem with my modem, when both tv and internet are out. A reasonable person would consider that even if I removed or unplugged the modem, the tv service would still continue to work, as it has been working before. They have now increased my bill again because of the technician service charge, but also, continually add services to my account without my permission. For instance, I informed them that our family does not watch HD, but they continue to charge us for it. We do not rent their modem. We've always had our own modem. They have $10.00 charge per month for this. They are also re-charging a one-time installation charge of $39.95, which they should not be, since no new equipment is being installed, and a on site service visit of $39.95 for a problem that is outside of the house. It is very unfair the way they treat their customers. I have had an email account with Comcast for a very long time, since 2003, and rely on my Comcast email address to communicate. The service area of Islamorada that we live in is known for having terrible issues with Comcast, since their service techs don't like to come out here. In fact, when we moved here 1 and 1/2 years ago, it took us two months of false promises and cancellations to get Comcast service. Requests to speak to supervisors have never been returned. We are requesting your assistance/intervention, and thank you in advance.

Comcast Business Phone/Internet Contract Disagreement,2015-04-04,Newnan,Georgia,30265,"I signed a 36 month contract with Comcast Business on July 12, 2012. My business closed in Dec 2012. Contract cancellation was @ $3000. Comcast offered to ""move"" the line to avoid cancellation fees and honor contract agreement - which was done July 2, 2013. I called April 3, 2015 to start initiating cancellation procedures ~ and was told that when the line was moved, the 36 month contract started over...meaning the contract doesn't end until July 2, 2016. I did agree to move the line ~ but I was never told this would add another year to my contract. On April 3, 2015 ~ Comcast customer service lowered my payment by $30 month...but I am extremely displeased about the contract extension without my knowledge. This extension is an additional $1000+ that I was not aware of!
 To honor our contract, we have dealt with slow internet speeds and have had no cable service during this time (Comcast business does not allow cable tv at a home business account). I would only ask Comcast to honor their contract and end our service July 12, 2015.

Multiple billing an dcompetative issues.,2015-06-23,Federal Way,Washington,98023,"I have multiple complaints about Comcast, my service provider:
 1. Our network speed that we get with Comcast is not what we pay for, its often much slower than the marketing and bills describe. As a result I cant help but feel lied to when i pay for one thing and get something significantly different.
 2. Our bills are often far too high and they refuse to lower them to fair levels; We find they have added a lot of junk fees at times, or simply increased prices without telling us or letting us say ""no"".
 3. It is not uncommon for me to find that they have billed me for services that I never agreed to accept.
 4. They have in the past attempted to bill me for my own hardware, and I have in the past had to pay to use my OWN EQUIPMENT.
 5. Unfair billing practices. In addition to the above its not uncommon to attempt to get these things fixed, only to be hung up on or outright told they refuse to assist me. They literally steal money form me every month and then say I'm in some sort of contract I never agreed to, that they can never give proof of.
 6. I have been forced to be a customer for years as they are a monopoly and nobody else services my area. I'm told that the reason for this is that Comcast will not ALLOW the competition when I ask other providers, and so as a result I am not able to use the providers I want to get 1gb fiber for my home as they are not allowed to service my area due to restrictions created by Comcast.
 7. I have overpaid them due to these issues and they refuse to refund my money when they should be.

Connecting the service,2015-06-20,Bethesda,Maryland,20817,"I went to Comcast service centre at 50 west guide dr suite 60, Rockville , MD on Thursday June 11, 2015 to subscribe to Internet and TV services as a new customer, and they let me pay $ 77.98 as a one month advance deposit.
 I tried to connect the service by myself as they recommend but it was useless. I called the technical support and they told me they will send someone on Monday, June 15, 2015 from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I stayed as home waiting for the technician, and at 4:44 pm a got a call from them to tell me the technician will be late and he will come maximum by 7:00 pm, so I agreed on that as I had no choice and I waited but nobody was showed up. I called and be surprised by an automated response telling me that my appoint rescheduled to Wednesday June 17, 2015 without any notes. After that the appointment rescheduled to Sunday June 21, 2015 after a long call with the customer service to complain. Unfortunately , I got a phone call today Saturday June 20, 2015 and they want to reschedule my appointment again which was a shock to me as I never expected that to happen after all my calks and complains with their customer services. To add to all of that, I received an email from Comcast on June 16, 2015 sending me a bil of $ 107.71 due on July 6, 2015 and I have not even activated their seri ice till now.
 Because of that some friends advised me to file a complain with you as you can protect the customer from such issues.
 P.S
 I tried to solve that with them but I couldn't and I tried to reach a higher level in customer service to speak about that but I couldn't reach anyone. In general it is difficult to reach them.
 Thank you and I do seek your help because I feel they screw me up.

Comcast billing problem,2015-04-12,Atlanta,Georgia,30308,"On December 20, 2014, I realized my introductory year on my Comcast Internet plan would end in January 2015. I decided to call Comcast to discuss options for the upcoming year of 2015 for my Internet service. I webchatted with Hittesh, the customer service representative. This is the copied part of our webchat that clarifies our agreement (screenshot attached): “, I have checked for you and I am not getting anything lower then your current package price with same package internet plus. However I can give you same package of $ 39.99 for next 12 months from today onwards. It will stay same till next year 12/20/2015. How this sound?” We agreed to these terms, and he assured me this would be included on my account.
 Then, I received my bill in January 2015 in the amount of $62.59. The monthy bill should have been the same as in 2014, which was $52.65. (There are changes for a modem lease and tax on top of the aforementioned $39.99 package price.)
 On February 2, I spoke with a few personnel to clear up the issue. I had the screen shot (attached) as evidence of the agreement Hittesh and I had reached, so I thought it was a simple mistake in the system. The personnel went on to tell me that it was a mistake on the part of customer service and could not be allowed by the billing department, that the $62.59 bill was the lowest they could offer me. They routed me to a few people in different departments and even told me I needed to call customer service and “renegotiate” the terms with them (which they also conflictingly told me would be impossible to “enforce” in billing regardless). The people I spoke with include Alexandra (AD4) and Javier Cavalie in the billing department (direct line at 954.534.7151). Javier assured me he would resolve the issue and get back with me, telling me I could call him directly. He then went on to ignore my phone messages and never got back in touch. This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have had, but of course there are few options for Internet service.
 My compliant is that even with documentation (attached) of an agreement between customer service and a customer, Comcast does not uphold their own self-made commitment. Please let me know if there is anything that can be done.
 Many thanks,

Comcast bundles useless services to charge more.,2015-06-30,Houston,Texas,77025,"I am a Comcast customer because they are the only internet provider in my area that offers the internet speeds that I need to stream lectures for school. Comcast has a history of monopolizing their prices and Houston Texas is no different. A year ago I was offered the promotional rate of 55.00 for cable TV and internet. I do not ever use cable TV, and do not ever plan to use it. I took this deal because it was less expensive to get the combination than it was to get only internet at the speeds I need. Comcast is inflating the number of their cable ""users"" by offering the internet packages bundled with cable for a lower rate than simply internet. The promotional year has past and to continue the same level of service my bill would be 70.00. This is another promotional rate, still bundled with cable. The cost of just internet at the same speed is 78.00 but you are required to also subscribe to digital TV or digital voice. The least expensive extra service increases my bill by 20.00. These extra services are of no value to me. There is no way to purchase just internet at the speed that I want. What Comcast is doing is not right. They are requiring that I bundle useless services and pay more for them when all I want is one service and I should be paying less for the single service that I want. Comcast can manipulate their customers this way because they are the only providor in the area offering the faster internet speeds. They should not be allowed to do this.

unfair Internet prices,2015-06-23,Little Rock,Arkansas,72223,"I have had Comcast Internet for 3 years now and it has been nothing short of a nightmare dealing with this company. When I first started with Comcast, they had to come out to inspect the lines and supposedly install new lines if they needed to. The tech that came out gave us a modem and checked the lines and said they were in pretty bad shape but as long as we were only going to use Internet, it would still be fine. The tech also wrote down and turned in the wrong address (Apt. 1302 that I didn't find out about till later). After a month of Internet connection dropping and horrible speeds, Comcast decided to send another tech out. This tech said that the lines were in such bad shape but refused to install new lines saying they weren't allowed even with written permission from my property manager. Third times a charm because I kept complaining and they send another tech. This tech ran a line from the box outside to the living room window. Even though this line wasn't buried and just laying on the ground to get rained and snowed on, I accepted this because he got the internet to work. Some months went by and everything seemed to work fine though I had started to notice the address was wrong and tried several times to correct it which proved a huge deal because not one customer agent could do this for me citing that they would have to close the account and start a new one. I finally agreed to this after being assured that no problems would occur and since my bill was current. They started a new account and closed the old one with the wrong apartment number but doing so I lost the pricing I was on. Comcast then took me off my promotional package and prices started to rise sharply. I was paying $35-$40 a month and when to $55. They said they could lower my price if I bundled with tv. I tried to explain to them that my one line wouldn't allow that to happen even if I did want tv from them. They said they couldn't help me with the price if I didn't bundle. So I bundled the internet and Tv into one package even though I cannot get the TV service. Now prices have started to rise again to $73. They once again say nothing they can do as I express that I can't and don't want the TV package. To top it all off, I checked my credit score and there is an account from Comcast that says there is a balance which is affecting my score. Of course no one from Comcast can tell me anything about it since they keep saying there isn't a balance. Is there nothing that can be done about a company that cares so little about its customers? I truly have never felt so helpless to a company before and wish I could take my services somewhere else yet Comcast is the only provider that isn't through the phone line in my area and they know it.

 4) sign me up for recurring payments for $64.95 after a 30 day ""trial"" period.

 On their website, in their FAQ, they even have a question and answer:
 ""How did I sign up for an ACTIVE Advantage trial membership?""
 And their answer is:
 ""When registering online for an activity/event through the ACTIVE Network (including reserving a campsite on Reserve America), you may be presented with the opportunity to try ACTIVE Advantage free for 30 days. This offer is displayed after your registration is complete, but before your registration confirmation page. To opt-in to the trial membership offer, you are required to verify and re-enter your email address, and then select an offer acceptance button. If you are not interested in the Advantage trial membership, you simply have to click ""No Thanks"". With either choice you will then be taken to your registration/reservation confirmation page.
 If you do choose to try the Advantage trial membership, you will receive a trial confirmation email. Half way through your trial membership period you will receive another ""checking in"" email that highlights featured discounts and encourages you to take advantage of the membership benefits. At the end of your 30 day trial we will extend your member benefits for a full year at the then-current
 annual membership fee (currently $64.95) and will send a notification email about the membership status change and billing.
 Of course, you're always protected by our Member Satisfaction Pledge. Even if you decide after your 30 day trial period has ended that you're not satisfied with your membership, just let us know and we'll give you a pro-rated refund for the unused months--no questions asked!""
 THIS IS FRAUD!
 THIS IS PREDATORY!
 THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL!
 From their main page, at the bottom-right, the two links FAQ and Help Center. In the Help Center link (http://activesupport.force.com/usersupport/) you can clearly see they discuss the charges etc., that would appear on one's CC bill.
 The FCC should enact a law that makes it illegal for anyone to use one else's CC information while paying for a service to sign them up for another service.
 If you google complaints about active.com, you'll be amazed at how many there are. A few of them:

Comcast Billing (primary) Service (secondary),2015-06-12,Pontiac,Michigan,48342,"This is the second month that I have received incorrect billing from Comcast for my internet service. I have had to deal with incorrect billing in the past, but I will limit this complaint to only this current instance.
 On December 7, 2015 I received an email confirmation from Comcast that my internet bill would be set at $54.99 per month less a echo bill discount of $5.00 per month on the internet plus package so that the bill would be $49.99 per month plus taxes and broadcast fees. I would have preferred internet only as there are no taxes, franchise fees or local tv broadcast fees, but that package costs even more that the one with basic TV. I do not even use the TV portion of the package as I have an antenna on the roof for this purpose.
 Last month, my bill inexplicably went up so I called Comcast. Called on Friday 5/15/2015 . Talked to two different people because of rate increase from $55.41 (54.99 – 5.00 eco bill discount + 3.25 broadcast tv fee +2.17 tax) to $70.84 ($ 15.43 increase)
 Was told that it would be corrected by Tuesday May 19th and the rate extended until June of 2016, but it was not.
 Called again on Thursday 5/21/2015 and talked to two more people again. They both told me they could not send an confirmation email like the last one I got in December for the locked in rate.
 I should have $15.43 credit on my account before I pay the May bill due on May 28, 2015. The rate should be locked in again at $55.41 until the June 2016 Bill. What actually happened was a package adjustment and a credit that netted the correct amount for May, but it still resulted in additional cost. The package is now correct, but the adjustment procedure cost me additional money ($5.67).
 Add to this the aggravation of the getting calls from my home alarm service because Comcast goes down for varying lengths of time several times a month. My alarm company does not see the ping from my alarm panel and calls me thinking the cable has been cut. I did not complain about this because it usually only happens three or four times a month but almost always around 3:00 A.M.

Internet Provider Data Thresholds,2015-04-02,Franklin,Tennessee,37064,"Data thresholds are set artificially low. I live in the Nashville area and Comcast Xfinity has a data threshold of 300 GB per month. After that, the consumer is charged $10 per 50 GB. 300 GB is a ridiculously low threshold in the age of streaming music, video and watching content - especially at HD quality that most households use. My family of five easily exceeds that with watching a few favorite shows on Netflix, Hulu and iTunes movies.
 The last couple of months, my Internet overage charges equalled my contract price. Most of the country does not have overage charges yet this is a stated plan on Comcast's website to potentially roll this out nationwide.
 If anything, the use of data threshold seems designed to get you to buy expensive cable packages that no longer reflect consumer interests. I was also offered Comcast's streaming service that competes with Netflix but it also consumes data.
 The only unlimited data package from Comcast is a very expensive one through their business unit.
 Data thresholds are costly to consumers and dis-incentives people from using the Internet for content, research, exploration and learning. There is no issue of congestion and there is certainly little to no investment of new fiber lines for those who are paying these exorbitant rates.

Comcast Won't Cancel My Service,2015-05-22,Atlanta,Georgia,30318,"I called in late April 2015 to have my service end on May 2, 2015. The customer service
 representative confirmed to me that it would be cancelled, but I was still being charged.
 I called again on May 22, 2015 after I received another bill. I was redirected multiple times, only to be
 abruptly hung up.
 Comcast continues to charge me for service and will not let me end it, even though I no longer reside
 at the service address.",
Billing Issue,2015-06-02,Port Barrington,Illinois,60010,"We have two home and two comcast accounts. When we are in florida, we keep internet at our Illinois address so that we can operate our security cameras in Illinois. In January of 2015, we noted that our security cameras were not working and were not sure what the problem was. We guessed it could be our security system and knowing that someone needs to be there when a service call is filed, we had to wait till we returned in May to address the issue. Upon returning we found that the internet at our Illinois home was also out and immediately called for a service call. While at our home, the comcast service representative explained that the problem originated from the fact that comcast had cut our service as there was a problem in the area and it was directly related to our house. We asked why we were not notified and were told that this is how its done. They cut it and wait for the customer to complain. The problem was where our house was connected to the main line and a quick fix resolved the problem. I contacted comcast immediately and asked why; a) we were not notified, b) that they had left our home without security cameras and c) why they continued to charge us for service we did not have. I placed a call to comcast and was assured that we would receive a $276 credit for the period that we were without internet and that it would be processed within 72 hours. Instead, I checked online and it was not there and we received a subsequent bill with an additional $9.50 in late charges. This prompted a second complaint and I was told by Iris, their representative, that our request for credit was denied as we did not report the outage. I informed Iris, that we could not be sure what the problem was, our system or theirs and it was not cost effective for us to fly back from Florida, rent a car, just for a service call as this would cost us well over $500. However, the communication breakdown was on their end when their service department failed to communicate to them that they had cut our service. I was then referred to Vincent who is a supervisor in the billing department, who said that he was authorized to provide a $150 credit only. This is the limit of his authority to make adjustments. He said the additional $122+ and the $9.50 would be re-escalated to the complaint department for a second review. I am appalled by the way that this has been handled. We are longtime comcast customers with their service at two locations. I cannot believe that it is their policy to charge individuals for service they do not have and would like assistance in ensuring that we receive credit for the full time that our service was disrupted due to their actions in cutting it.

BAIT and SWITCH Product Offerings for Internet BLAST Service,2015-05-27,Naples,Florida,34104,"After being told by a local (Naples, FL) Comcast Representative that my internet service cost would
 be $39.99 for 24 months, Comcast almost DOUBLED my rate ($78.95). On 05/27/2015, from Naples,
 FL @ 0700, I called Comcast customer service. I spoke with ""Dan"" in the Philippines and explained
 the situation. Dan said he could not help me and I would have to speak to a different representative
 in another department but they did not open until 0800. I waited until 0830 and called the department
 Dan instructed me to call which was ""Downgrade my service"". This time I got a person named ""Loita""
 also in the Philippines. I explained the situation to her and what I had been promised as $39.99 for
 their BLAST internet service. She explained she would ""re-instate"" my ""promotional rate"" for another
 12 Months @ $39.99. She explained I would have to make my payment of $78.95 and that I would
 be credited the difference ($38.96) on my next bill (June 25th). She said she would email me the
 terms and that I should make my payment after I received the email. FOUR hours passed and I did
 not receive ANY email. I call back again to the same number and options. This time I got ""Art""
 employee number 1581275 ALSO in the Philippines. I explain I have not received the email that Loita
 said she was sending me. He then checked my account and now tells me the price I will receive is
 now $78.95 but he will make sure I get the ""promotional rate"" NOW of $49.99.
 The FCC needs to levy some heavy fines and penalties on this company. This is now the SECOND
 time they have attempted to pull this on me. I ended up having to drive to a ""local"" Comcast
 storefront to get it straightened out the last time which was a was of my time and gas mileage. I
 KNOW this is not just me this is happening to. I hear these complaints all the time from people in my
 area. This time I am not sitting back and ignoring it.",
Worst customer service with no resolution,2015-06-10,Milpitas,California,95035,"I simply wanted to move services from one apartment to another and it took me more than 3 calls and 5 hours to get that done. Once the guy came home to install, they didn't even move services correctly. I had to call again to get my Internet working. After that I had to call again to get my Xfinity on Demand working. Then I had to go to the Xfinity store to change my cable box to get that to work. All this took more than 10 hours and several calls!
 And now, today, my credit card gets billed for 92.95 without even getting a bill! When I call xfinity again, I was told after moving services, I get a new account number and that was not added to my previous account/login. So I was transferred from the billing department to whoever to get this done. That guy took more than 30 minutes and could not even add my new account number to my existing account. He kept trying and asked me to lgoout and login several times and he couldnt do a simple thing like that. I would believe that if I have moved services, all these things happen in the background even without me having to do anything, So I am still stuck and cant even see my new account number and service address after I login to xfinity account. As a result I dont see my new bill and because my previous address was on auto pay, xfinity very happily just took the money from my credit card without sending me the bill. To make it worse, that guy on the phone said he will transfer me to the specialist team to resolve this and after waiting on the line for 15 minutes, a lady came on the phone and she was from the security department and said she doesnt handle service requests. Then why was I transferred there and why is Xfinity customer service so bad!! I want my money back! Is this the kind of customer service xfinity wants to provide?? I want someone from Xfinity to resolve this and also compensate me for this.

Service out/no customer service provided,2015-06-18,Knoxville,Tennessee,37909,"Our service has gone out again today. When trying to call for assistance I get bounced around between people, then hung up on with no resolution. The purpose of my calls were to get credit for today's services on my account. All I was told is that service is out in the entire region. I can not get credit to my account when my calls are ignored, bounced around, and hung up on. I am sure I am not the only customer trying to get credit to my account for this wide spread outage. I will continue to call, but I feel everyone in the region that is affected should receive credit to their account for today's lack of service since customer service is unavailable or unwilling to take customer calls. If customers are unable to reach Comcast to get their credit for the day, I feel it is unjustified for everyone affected to not be treated the same and receive credit for today's ""regional"" outage.

Comcast,2015-06-10,Dover,Pennsylvania,17315,"I called to set up service with Comcast I wanted the date of May 26 at that time was advised that it would be best to move it to the date the computer would be here which would be May 29. On May 29 they where scheduled to come out at 12 and the tech arrived informing me he could not leave converter boxes because all tv's were not present, I informed tech I was never informed that this was a requirement any other time they turn the cable on and I hook the cable up myself and if there are any problems I call in and Comcast trouble shoots and sends a signal and all is well. I called Comcast because the tech said he did not have a number for me to call and after being transferred and disconnected they did verify that this is policy and there sorry I was miss informed but they could not leave the converter boxes, I after speaking with Comcast found the tech in my driveway smoking cigarettes and on a personal call talking about he didn't know I was ready he thought I was still on the phone. I told him I am done and you need to get busy so he told the person he had to call them back cause he was at a customers home. So since 1 tv was here and 1 computer I instructed the tech to hook those 2 up. The tech proceed to try to hook up the 2 then informs me that he had more bad news he can not find the wiring for the front 2 rooms and the lines are are not working and that I need to call a tech to run new cable lines as the home owner's association guidelines does not allow Comcast techs to do this service and that I would need to get this installation cancelled so the tech called in and ask me to cancel installation which I did. Now keep in mind I already took had took Friday off to have this done. I then took off Wed June 3 so the tech could come and run cable lines. The tech entered my premises and was able to find the cable line in less than 3 minutes and was able to tell me after his assessment and testing there was nothing wrong with the lines. I then called Comcast and informed them of the techs inaccuracy and that hiring a tech to do a job that Comcast should be able to provide does not sit well with me. A agent then informed me the earliest they could get me a New installation date would be June 16, I explained this is unacceptable for such poor service. The agent contacted his supervisor who told the agent he had to do a forced appointment for June 16 but would contact me before the close of business Thurs June 4 with an sooner appointment than June 16. I also went to Xfinity in York PA and asked to speak to a manager to file a complaint and was informed they were only the sales division and they would send a memo out to the installation dept informing them of what transpired and to see if they could get me a sooner appointment and she would contact me before close of business Thurs also. Unfortunate to say I did not hear back from either xfinity York Pa or the Supervisor so I called in to Comcast again I informed them that neither party responded back so was tranfered to installation who stated they could only do a forced appointment for June 10 between 12pm and 5pm since I had an appointment and I cancelled it, but I let them know I only cancelled because the tech instructed me too. I informed the tech that I have to be to work and can not accommodate that schedule the best I could do is to have the tech be here before 12 and be done by 2pm. Well sadly to say it's 12pm and no tech so I call in again and the tech informs me that they see the note but I am a squeeze in and when they get time they will get to me and there is nothing they can do. I have taken 1 day of work to have Comcast installed. Which
 didn't get done then I took another day off work because the Comcast tech said I needed to have 2 cable lines installed and had to hire a tech only to find out their is nothing wrong with the cable lines and now it is 1:30pm and still no tech and I won't get cable installed again cause I have to get back to work.

horrible service charges for tech/installation applied when they shouldnt have,2015-06-05,Chicago,Illinois,60620,"I made the mistake and got Comcast internet almost two months ago. First it took almost two weeks due to them having another tenant listed in my apartment#1. Then I had to keep calling kept getting the run around. Then finally when it was alledgedly straighten out. The CSR told me that the $60.00 charge for installation/tech would be waived and that she could not do it that day due to the ""billing"" process which was another lie. I called back the next day after installation to make sure the account was updated and was told that ""oh yes, dont worry about it it will automatically be updated. Of course that wasn't done. Service was interrupted on 5/30/2015 and I spent over 3 hours calling the 800#, talking with billing and them telling me there wasn't anything that they could do. Then I tried dialing local comcast and they didn't know what to do. I asked several times to speak to a Supervisor last Saturday and was denied and switched back into the que to start all over again. My bill is suppose to be $29.99 plus tax per month. Not the first bill of 95.00 Comcast has lied over and over including expecting me to talk to the tenant and go into the local office when the technician who installed service for the other knew they were not in my apartment # and he should have called it in to verify it and CHANGE THE APT#. It has been nothing but HELL since the first conversation. Why would anyone agree to a$60.00 charge to hook up internet when you can clearly do it yourself. It's not hard. I even said no to the charge and it was suppose to have been waived because it took comcast over a week to supply the service and now the one person that I did speak to on June 1st, is stating a ""play on the words"" that the csr entered when she put the service order in. GO BACK AND LOOK UP MY ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO YOUR QA CALLS. See how many times I called in the beginning and how many times I called on 5/29 and 5/30/2015. This is ridiculous. I'm going to keep calling someone in the State of Illinois including a BBB complaint until it is resolved. Denying me a Supervisor. Waiting for 3-45 mn per call for someone to answer not including the csr who have me a 800# that isn't even associated with Comcast. Then because I didn't have the bill with the account # on it and my mother was on the phone trying to help me the csr stated she could not look it up by telephone# or last four of ssn which is an outright lie. Comcast hooked service up in the basement of someone who gave their apartment# as #1 instead of basement. The tech rang my bell in 12/2014 when he came out stating that he had an order for apartment#1. I said no he didn't but he apparently installed it anyway knowing these people did not live in apt#1. But, sent me through hell stating that they took my slot in the two flat building. This held my service up for over 10 days. No apology or anything. Then you want to add $60.00 for a tech. No way. I didnt even know that Comcast mailed the equipment until my 20th phone call. Comcast is training its employees to make the sale by saying whatever is necessary. Then when you try to call back with questions or try to resolve any problems you get treated like crap. Since more than one person exhibited this behavior it must be common place. LISTEN TO YOUR CALLS! LOOK UP THE ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO THE CALLS.

Comcast Data Policy and Lies,2015-06-20,Murfreesboro,Tennessee,37128,"I live in Tennessee where Comcast Cable places data caps on customers for their service. I recently had and overage charge and was told by a customer account specialist that I can avoid overages by paying $10 more a month for an alternate plan of 105 mbps allowing for a total of 600 GB data allowance instead of the normal 300 GB. I gladly accepted and changed my plan. I had some other problems with the provider I had to clear up with regards to other services and spoke to 8-12 Comcast representatives within the past month. I was told from 90% of these representatives that that is correct. I spoke to a supervisor today because I got an alert I had gone over the data cap and show I am only 1/2 way to 600 GB and the supervisor advised me all the other people I had spoken with were wrong and I am responsible for the overages. He explained that the speed I pay for only gets 300 GB data allowance unless I live in Arizona and there is nothing they can do. On the phone they advised the policy states ""no customer can pay more for a plan that allows for more data"" and yet they find Arizona is an exception which is unfair to other consumers with the same plan who just happen to live in a different state. All this while some areas are not held to the data cap standards they have created. After speaking with the supervisor I called again to another department and the first thing she said was yes the 105 mbps plan I had allows for 600 GB. I advised her what I was just told and she finally found a similar piece of information that is exclusive to Arizona. I feel they are misleading customer coaxing them into paying more money by lying and then offering no options to get what they offered.

Comcast internet price high,2015-06-23,Hollywood,Florida,33024,"Dear FCC,
 I have comcast Internet and paying $45 a month for my internet on a promo for around 6 months after the promotion it is $73 each month. When I call comcast they tell me if I want to save more I have to have a bundle but I don't need the extra things they offer.
 Why can't they just have a better fixes rate instead of the promos that only last around 6 months and after that you can not get on a new promotion.

Comcast/Xfinity Internet Data Cap,2015-06-30,Senoia,Georgia,30276,"Comcast/Xfinity's data caps have only been adjusted 50gbs in the last 6 years. This is unrealistic and not conducive to modern lifestyles. They only allow 300 GB and then charge fees when you go over...even if you also pay for cable through them. I really don't want to spend my children's college funds on being able to use the internet!

Comcast internet freezes up,2015-06-01,Brentwood,Tennessee,37027,"A box appeared on top of my email saying I should use Xfinity internet. I closed the box. It came up two more times and the last time it froze my email. I could not use my email and there was no way to close the box. I called Comcast and asked them to remove the box and let me back into my email. They did something and after an hour I finally got my email back. This is the second time this has happened. I don't want to use Xfinity for my email. It was suggested that I call the security department to make sure that this didn't happen again. They never answered the phone. I held on for 18 minutes, then called back and held on for about 20 more minutes. I don't want this to happen again. They, also, slow down my internet every night between 6 and 10:00. Sometimes it takes up to 4 minutes (I timed it!) to open an email. I'm paying for high speed service and don't think that they should do this.

XFINITY/COMCAST TETHERING CONNECTION,2015-06-21,Clovis,California,93612,"I bought an Xbox One in April of this year, 2015; Ever since, my internet connection has been boggled down. Before my purchase of the Xbox we had a download speed of 128Mbps with uploads of 10-12Mbps but the only items used on the network were 2 pcs, a laptop, 2 tablets, and 2 phones. But now that we have the Xbox, we all of a sudden drop from 128Mbps to anywhere from 25Mbps to 50Mbps if we are lucky to get even that but the upload speeds remain at 10-12Mbps. It's clear that we are being penalized for having an Xbox after years of service to the same company who has a monopoly on the entire surrounding area, and frankly a $200+ monthly bill should provide the service that I'm supposedly ""guaranteed"". The sooner Google can come to California the better because someone needs to send all these monopolizing companies a nice wake up call for terrible service, overpricing, and just the generalized screw the customer because they have no other options bull crap.

Internet Service Provider Comcast harassing me to return equipment I already returned,2015-06-29,Indianapolis,Indiana,46237,"Comcast has sent my name and number to a collections agency claiming I never returned equipment. I physically returned the equipment in person to a Comcast store on June 12 and have a dated receipt for equipment. Since then, I have started receiving automated calls from Comcast to return equipment.
 After every call, I have called Comcast for information on my account. I opened an ER ticket (what Comcast calls an inventory search and request) at a Comcast store and a second ER ticket over the phone. This was to confirm that I have no outstanding equipment at my house. I have multiple calls recorded where the Comcast representative says I don't have any extra equipment and they will make notes to stop the calls. I spoke with an employee at a Comcast store who said, and showed me the screen, that I have no extra equipment.
 I spoke with someone from the collections agency (Universal Systems) who says they only received notification of the unreturned equipment on June 17. This is five days after I returned it with receipt. It is the same day I opened the first ER ticket (what Comcast calls an inventory search request) about equipment Comcast claims was missing.
 I have included two Account numbers since I briefly had to open a second account due to moving complications. One of them is currently closed.
 The URL where I am hosting audio of the phone calls or copies of the return receipts can be provided if requested.

bait and switch,2015-05-02,Algonquin,Illinois,60102,"On the xfinity website, they offer Digital Economy television service (45+ channels) for $19.99 per
 month and Economy Plus internet service (3 Mbps) for $19.99 per month. I was able to add both
 these services to the cart and check out. However, the xfinity representative called a couple of days
 later and said that I could not have the services selected even though either one was available in my
 area. Instead they said I would have to select either their Internet Plus package (10 channels and 25
 Mbps Internet) for 39.99/mo or their Blast Plus (45 channels and 50 Mbps) for 59.99/mo. When
 escalated to a manager they indicated that it was because I was selecting both a TV and Internet
 offer. There was no disclosure on teh website that both offers are not available together and it seems
 outragous that I can not take advantage of both deals.",
Comcast deceptive selling billing lack of service - SECOND And EXPANDED COMPLAINT,2015-05-31,Evans,Georgia,30809,"About 5/6 months ago I returned a HD box and one smaller box both with remote controls. I was told
 that the small box was not on my account and that they would have to investigate and get back with
 me NOTHING
 On May 19th I called about what specials you have with a triple play, The package I was offered
 included your new Xfinity 1 box, upgrade to 105 gb data, HO, Starz and Stream plex, also I could get
 additional Premium channels for only $2 more a month total package would be good for 2 years. The
 current phone modem would work for my system I said, let me call back tomorrow and I’ll confirm, the
 rep said he would attach the package to my account.
 On May 20th, I call and got some female in the Philippines. I said I called yesterday and there is a
 package attached to my account. She proceeded to ask me what the package was, then she said
 give me 2 minutes. When she came back the price increased, I said that was not right, Again she
 said give me 2 minutes, when she came back she had the right price but the wrong package again
 give me two minutes, now she got most of the package right, and again ask for 2 more minutes. She
 also said I needed a new modem, yet the prior rep said I did not. Finally after getting the initial
 package right and price right she stated that besides the price had to pay something like an additional
 $75, install and return. I said NO I am going to install by myself. Again give me 2 minutes after
 about a total 50 minutes on the phone she said that it was taken care of, but there were only a few
 minutes left for me to take the special discount. I locked in and she said the xfinity 1 box will be sent
 out 3-5 business days.
 I called back on May 21st to confirm, and spoke to a supervisor in Texas who said she would monitor,
 never hear or see anything from the supervisor.
 On May 22 I received my Comcast box, but it was another modem, I called and Comcast said they
 would send the right one out. In the mean time the DVR box I had lost channels and got worse every
 time I called. In addition my phone service went down again (this was frequent). Also same day, I
 spoke to Andre a supervisor from Columbia who tried to get my internet up, but no luck, he set up a
 service tech on May 26 for internet and DVR box.
 When the tech came out on May 26th, I spoke to him about the initial DVR box (over the phone, my
 wife was home). Needless to say he did nothing with the internet or DVR box. Later that day we
 received the Xfinity 1 box, I followed all directions, but when I went to register over the phone I kept
 getting busy signals. Finally I contacted Comcast again and she was able to register my Xfinity box.
 After going through the channels I only had the basic channels, so back on the phone to Comcast,
 Now I get Janiki from Alabama who was helpful in straightening out the issues. At this point I spent at
 least 5 hours on the phone and the internet was still not up. On May 28th, after 8 attempts I got
 through to the US and spent 2 hours getting the internet setup, during that time the US agent got
 someone from the Philippines (internet help) and again anther useless person, who spoke with a
 strong dialect, did not understand my questions and kept on saying let’s go back and start again. The
 person from the US remained on the phone while all this was going on. After the internet was up and
 the person from the Philippines was gone, I told him that he resolved 99.9% of my issues and most
 likely would have solved all of them and a lot sooner without the person from the Philippines.
 I still have the issue of the last small box I returned and have other boxes to return. I am skeptical
 that if I ship them back using UPS I have no recourse and either Comcast will say that these boxes
 are not on my account or say they never ever received them. Now on May 30, 2015, my cable is
 finally up, phone is up and intermittent internet service. I was notified that my bill is $238.78, which I
 was total over the phone would be around $165 including taxes. It should also be less due to credits
 from the above returned item, prior issues of service not being available and once the new service
 was establish, it was not totally functioning. It appears that Comcast uses off shore personal to sell,
 but when billed the Comcast customer has to again deal with the off shore incompetence in getting all
 issues resolved. I currently have spent nearly 10 HOURS with my time and do not want to spent any
 more time.",
Data overage charges,2015-06-24,Southaven,Mississippi,38671,"Over the past year, our household has been paying data overage charges for using our service as we have always done. We live in fear of going over our imposed data cap and being charged for it. With Comcast only imposing these caps in certain markets, I feel like we are being taken advantage of. Why should we have to pay for overages when the rest of the country doesn't have to pay for them. It is severely limiting out access to the Internet.

Bandwidth Caps becoming excessive,2015-06-23,Augusta,Georgia,30907,"I get charged, on average, $50 in overages per month. I feel as though 300Gb is not nearly enough in today's high-bandwidth world. I have noticed an increase since testing Windows 10 at home, as a member of the Microsoft Insider testing group. Each time a new build is released it downloads a DVD worth of data to upgrade the machine to a new build. I am testing it on two machines (desktop and tablet) so effectively I get hit with double the usage each time it happen. On top of that I am a cord-cutter purely because Comcast refuses to release an application for XBox One which is the only device I choose to use for media streaming. Worse, systems like XBox One now employ completed downloaded games instead f physical media so games that are 15Gb or larger can be downloaded frequently. 300Gb simply isn't enough anymore, so if caps are going to continue they need to raise them. Worse, I understand that this cap is only implemented in select areas, so why am I being punished because Comcast wants to test something they aren't even imposing everywhere?
 Mobile Devices + Application Testing + Gaming + Hulu + Netflix + Showtime Anywhere + HBO Go + Amazon Instant Video + Steam
 I don't download torrents or anything. I will be the first to admit that I have done this in the past, but there is so much available now via streaming I have no need to do this. Yet I pay through the nose anyway...
 Someone needs to do something. I am in an area with no alternatives other than Comcast and I feel like I am being punished for using them. As we speak I am working on enabling SNMP on my router, so that I can track my usage using PRTG in order to identify my actual usage compared to what Comcast says I use. I am also engaging WOW (formerly Knology) to see what I can do to get them into my neighborhood.

 I am really upset. I had hand carried a copy of the transaction history of my checking account to the Infinity office in Bolingbrook Il. This was after several attempts to email the information to Lorraine Westbrook at Comcast corp office. She claimed she didn't receive them. I don't know whether she did
 or not. At any rate I drove to the bank and picked up a printout from Mary Spyridoulias a banker at US Bank and delivered it to Comcast (the Bolingbrook Infinity office).
 Today I received a call from Lorraine Westbrook saying that what I had sent was not enough, she needed the transaction history. What I sent her states clearly that it is a transaction history. I don't know what to do now. They still have my money and are saying I an delinquent. I really need some direction here....thanks.

We haven't had the equipment in a month but still being charged $250 for it. Furthermore, when I got off work I called Comcast since my wife gave up, and was transferred 4 times and spent a hour on hold only for the call to disconnect 5 mins after 9 because the office closed. Still nothing has been resolved with Comcast and I am sure I am still being billed.

Comcast,2015-06-23,Brick,New Jersey,8724,"Comcast is the only Broadband ISP available in my area. Because of this, I have to pay more for services I do not use. I had the Blast Internet (125 Mb/s Down 10 Mb/s Down) which is the fastest package available. I had this for a year, and paid about $47 a month. After a year, I would have had to pay $80 for the standalone internet package. I called their Customer Solutions department and they told me that I had to get cable to get a better deal. I do not use cable TV since I have Netflix and other streaming sites and apps. Therefore, I was forced into getting more services than I use to make my bill go down each month. They did throw in HD free for a year, but that is about 25 channels as I got the lowest TV package.
 I would love to take my business elsewhere, however, there are no other providers in my area that meet the FCC standard of broadband.

Throttle of my Internet access speeds by Comcast,2015-05-16,Hatboro,Pennsylvania,19040,"I have attempted to identify with Comcast Customer Service why my download speeds have varied
 from 94 mbps to 9.5 mbps over a period of two weeks. They sent Tech Service people and could not
 find a reason & made the suggestion I house clean my computer which I already do daily. I
 mentioned to the visiting Comcast Tech that it may be caused by a failed Splitter. We replaced it, but
 no improvement happened. I did notice the my upload speed had also dropped from 12.5 mbps to
 9.5 mbps and I mentioned this to Darack, Darack left without fixing my Internet speed variation
 problem.
 A friend suggested I see if maybe Comcast was throttle my Internet access speeds because of
 something I was doing on my PC. I found what was causing it almost right away and I've been
 tracking it for almost a week now. I listen to various NPR radio stations over the iTune Internet Radio
 service. I applied the theory and immediately found that to be the cause. Within a few minutes of
 starting the iTune Internet Radio service my Internet access speed would drop significantly. And soon
 after I stopped the iTune Radio Service on my PC, my Internet Speeds would return to norm.
 I then contact Comcast/Xfinity support via their Chat Room and asked what I should do with my
 findings. They suggested I contact a special area of Comcast Service Support where I could file a
 complaint. Within minutes of my making Comcast aware that I found they were throttle my Internet
 access, the whole problem disappeared. Now even though I access the iTune Internet Radio NPR
 stations via my PC, my access speeds have not dropped as before from 94 mbps to 9.5 mbps. Now
 they are consistently around 92 to 94 mbps where they should have been all along.
 The only logical answer is that the Comcast Service representative adjusted my Internet Access
 setting for my account so the Throttle did NOT happen any more.
 I have a few more stories about Comcast if you care to listen from when I started my service of TV,
 Telephone & Internet four months ago.",
Unfair Comcast billing practices,2015-06-25,Mount Laurel,New Jersey,8054,"After signing up with Comcast internet (the only broadband ISP in my area), I was persuaded to sign up for cable as well. Comcast offered a lower promotional package deal of TV and internet for about $32 per month. Now about a few months later, the promotion has ended and my bill totals $65. I would like to cancel my Comcast TV service and continue only paying for internet. However, I was informed by Comcast customer service that canceling my cable service would INCREASE my bill by $30! Why would subtracting a service increase the cost of my bill? I only use Comcast internet, but I am being forced to carry the TV service.

I have asked Comcast numerous times to either provide service (which I would pay for) or at least fix their database so that my address is listed as not having service. Comcast has done neither.

Otherwise they may be forced to provide service because of the agreements with our municipality.

Problems with Comcast xfinity Internet service,2015-06-22,Miami,Florida,33145,"I bought Internet service from Comcast on 09/06/2015. They send the equipment two days later. I tried to self-installed and I wasn't able because there was something wrong with the wire box outside my house (apparently the access is set up fir ATT , my former provider) Therefore, they just need to send a technician, switch the cables outside to guarantee my access to Comcast signal and we are done. So, I schedule one first appointment, the technician never showed up. I called and spoke to a supervisor, she offered me a discount and said she would send somebody right away. That second appointment, no one showed. I called a supervisor, they said they were sorry and that the next day, from 8 to 10 a.m. someone would be here. They did not show. I called a supervisor, this time, the guy was very arrogant and said, you are talking to the right person, ""I got your back"" like if we were friends... I hung up on him, and he gave me a call back saying everything was ready, he would send somebody... no one showed,. On the 19th, I decided to call the Corporate Office in Philadelphia, the Relations Department told me that they were sorry, and that now it was in the hands of Corporate, it would be solved, that I would be contacted by Comcast before the day was over. Nobody called. I waited and waited. Today Monday 22th, I contacted Corporate back. They said, we are sorry, let me contact the regional office right now. She called and got no answer, so she said, I am going to send an email, they will be contacting you soon... and I said, thank you.
 I have made about 11 phone calls to Comcast, my estimated time on the phone, is more than 3 hours altogether. Since it all must be recorded, that should be enough evidence to prove my case.
 I have lived a nightmare. It is sad that a human being just trying to buy a service in America has to go through such humiliation.
 Thanks for your attention,

Discriminatory tiered pricing and traffic limitations by Comcast.,2015-06-12,Mobile,Alabama,36608,"Since October 1, 2013, Comcast has been charging consumers in Mobile, Alabama additional money for every 50 gb of traffic over an artificially mandated 300gb traffic limit. They have been conducting this ""test market"" of tiered pricing in other areas as well. (See https://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-Where-will-these-plans-be-launched). Complainant argues that Comcast should treat all of its customers across the nation equally. Whereas in other markets, no traffic limitation is currently being applied, Complainant and all others in the ""test markets"" have been charged additional money for internet traffic above and beyond an artificially set limit of 300gb, as if the data were a tangible utility such as water that were going to run out. Comcast has provided no rationale for the 300gb/month limitation other than congestion, and has provided consumers no evidence that such congestion actually exists.
 The arguments here are manifold, so I will address them separately:
 1. Comcast's entire customer base should be treated equally, and offered the same quality and pricing model of service unilaterally, other than acceptable market-based pricing dictated by free-market competition (where such exists).
 2. Comcast's argument for enacting this trial of traffic caps is that of network congestion and cost of last-mile provision. However, during the pendency of this ""test market"" trial, Comcast has contradicted such claims by opening up the WiFi routers of their individual customers for access to ALL Comcast customers, which implies that there is no necessary limitation to per-user traffic that would necessitate the 300gb/month limitation. Charging the consumer extra for exceeding a traffic limit while ignoring the traffic used by surrounding customers through that individual's internet connection is a contradiction that suggests there truly is no congestion issue.
 3. If Comcast is going to conduct ""test market"" trials such as these, Comcast should have to fully disclose the terms of such trials, including the full scope and end date of these trial data programs.
 4. As Comcast has now conducted these ""test market"" trials in the Mobile, Alabama area for 21 months, it would seem that Comcast has had ample time to assess the traffic needs of the test market areas and obtain any data they require for these test market trials, at the expense of their customers who have been forced to pay extra for additional traffic.
 5. On multiple occasions, via telephone and Comcast's internet support chat, Complainant has been told that this ""test market"" tiered pricing was due to expire. Most recently, Comcast's support representative informed Complainant that the 300gb/month limitation was being changed within two weeks. The approximate date of this change has come and gone, and to date, customers in the Mobile, Alabama area are still subject to the ""test market"" per-use pricing structure. Complainant can provide a text log of this support chat session upon request.
 6. By way of implication due to Comcast's inherent business interests in cable television content provision, Complainant asserts that the 300gb/month and $10.00 for each additional 50gb plan that Comcast has enacted on ""test market"" consumers exists solely to prevent its internet users from
 ""cutting the cord"" - i.e. consuming video content via internet streaming services rather than Comcast's own cable television service. This artificial limitation effectively prohibits consumers from using the internet as they see fit and discriminates against the innovative video streaming services that now dominate American internet usage. As the recent Title II reclassification now places limitations on ISPs re: discriminatory blocking and throttling of internet traffic, Complainant asserts that Comcast's test market limitation of 300gb/month of traffic before additional charges is a de facto method of discriminating against streaming video service traffic on their network.
 6a. Moreover, Complainant asserts that the monitoring of customer traffic for the purposes of charging additional money is invasive and violates the privacy rules set forth in the recent Title II reclassification and rules.
 6b. Worse, Complainant asserts that the 300gb/month limitation before additional pricing unfairly burdens existing markets who provide services via the internet. For instance, Microsoft offers downloadable games for its Xbox One gaming console which are typically 30-50gb in size. By placing a 300gb/month limitation on consumer traffic, Comcast is effectively stifling the innovation of this growing digital market. As the FCC's intention is to ensure that innovative new markets on the internet are not interfered with by the interests of Internet Service Providers, Complainant asserts that such artificial traffic limitations should be done away with. Comcast is free to charge what the market dictates for such last-mile provision of internet service, however, this service should essentially be a ""dumb pipe"" wherein the consumer may use it as they see fit, for the legal purposes they see fit, without Comcast's policies keeping emerging markets from further expansion.
 I look forward to discussing this matter further.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/18/2015 7:27:07 PM:
 A representative from Comcast contacted me today by phone. He essentially had no answers to give as to how long the ""test market"" would run, when they would have enough data from the ""test market"" to roll it out nationwide, etc. He basically told me that this was the way things were going (in reference to tiered per-use pricing based on your traffic), and then tried to blame net neutrality for it being this way. He even brought up that this pricing was better than their old policy of terminating a customer's service if they went over 250gb of traffic in a month, as if that policy were any less inane and discriminatory than the current one. He could not answer questions about congestion, or the contradiction between them claiming congestion exists and opening up everyone's WiFi router to all Comcast customers. Basically, this phone call from their representative went exactly the same way every call I have had with them on this matter has gone. They said they would log the complaint and that my feedback was important to them, without actually changing anything or offering any solutions.
 Therefore, my complaint stands. I would appreciate some comment by the FCC on this matter, and would welcome a discussion if the need arises. I do not feel that, as Comcast's representative told me, this is just ""the way things are going"". Or at least, it shouldn't be, if emerging digital content markets are going to survive.

Comcast's Monopolistic Practices and Data Capping,2015-04-12,Atlanta,Georgia,30315,"In light of the vote by the FCC to protect a free and open internet I would like to file a complaint about Comcast's use of internet usage caps in the Atlanta market.
 The current caps are set at a lower level than should be realistically acceptable in today's world of high-quality video streaming and cloud-based computing+storage.
 Furthermore, the current caps set by Comcast vary from market to market. Atlanta customers are paying the exact same price for capped data than customers in markets with unlimited data. We should not get markedly poorer service for identical costs.
 While I understand the need to have rules to deter serial bandwidth abusers, I feel that the current caps in the Atlanta market are in place due to a virtual monopoly. This observation is backed up by Comcast's sudden announcement of unlimited, uncapped 2gps fiber service coming soon to Atlanta, which would never have happened had Google Fiber not announced its far more competitive plans there in the future. Obviously if Comcast can offer uncapped 2Gps service to an estimated 18MM users, it is not nearly so strained for bandwidth that it must cap users at 300GB/mo. The cap is only viable due to their current monopoly.
 I am an ordinary consumer and not a business. However, I do two commonplace activities that shoot me far above Comcast's 300GB/mo cap:
 1) I stream Netflix TV shows a few days a week
 2) I use cloud-based backup services for my computer
 Backing up your computer is an absolute necessity. However, my laptop has a 1TB hard drive, so I end up needing to upload nearly 400GB just to back up my personal photos, videos, and documents - some of the most important things in my life.
 Data caps are anti-competition, are counter to our country's values about a free and open internet, are inflicted on users who initially signed contracts offering uncapped services, and are set at an unreasonably low bar.
 Please investigate Comcast's use of data caps in Atlanta and move to prevent these anti-consumer actions.

Comcast,2015-04-13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,15218,"Since July of 2014, Comcast has failed to report to me what I owed, admitted that my bill was incorrect, and promised to show me corrected bills that never arrived. Despite multiple inquiries, I was told that ""the system will adjust to reflect your bill accurately - you just have to give it time."" As I've waited, Comcast has charged me with late fees, shut off my service, and charged even more in reactivation fees. In total, I've paid $66.37 extra over the past 6 months, and now they're demanding $81.45 in addition to my normal $46.95 bill, or they will cancel my services. In total, Comcast has unlawfully charged an extra $66.37 and is currently holding my account hostage for an additional $81.45. Comcast should be required to report my bill accurately on each statement, and preclude the assessment of late fees until the statement is accurate.

Exacerbating that problem, the data meter I have to use to monitor my use doesn't work, neither on the website, nor the stand-alone app. I have talked to an agent 5 times with no attempt at resolution.

Deceptive sales- change in billing amount etc.,2015-04-15,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48104,"I ordered an internet plan. I was told it would be $49.99 but was billed $54.99. They said the 'extra' $5 was for not having ""Ecobilling"" yet i was never told that I needed this when I agreed to the plan & price.
 Furthermore, in the meantime. I've asked for a plan with a lower rate i can afford- just with internet- but they consistently come back with bundled plans that include TV etc. They have the only really acceptable product for inteernt service in my area.
 My request now is to be billed as I was sold- at $49.99/mo- already $5 over my previous plan & not $10as they've done. ( Though, i did try to get onto Ecobill- with no luck - & over an hour dealing with their reps,etc. & at this point I'd rather not)
 I feel their sales techniques & representation of the service & fee was deceptive. Their company was built on public trust- the laying of cable lines etc.- yet they go to great lengths to take advantage & squeeze out excessive rates. ( Also, $10/ month for modem rental? You've got to be kidding! I finally figured that out on my own & bought one)

comcast blocking HBO content for streaming.,2015-06-11,Port At Lucie,Florida,34953,"IMO it's not a bad business plan. It's a typical one.
 It's basicaly monopoly price fixing hand in hand with other companies. The large enteties have all sorts of cosy behind closed doors meetings to scupper us getting everything we paid for.
 They were not happy with how streaming should end the monopoly, so now they are limiting things like complete seasons via on demand. Now it's only 6 or se latest episodes on Xfinity on demand. Even Hulu are doing it now. It's all designed to make us pay more for a service we already paid for.
 I have paid so much money getting premium channels like HBO etc via Xfinity. I pay for Hulu. I pay for Amazon prime. I pay for PS plus. I pay for Netflix....
 What do I get? I can't even watch Gotham because of a closed doors, well planned monoply Hulu, Comcast, HBO, Amazon have to keep gouging us from all angles.
 I have to pay to watch early episodes of a season now. With all of the extras I pay for, this is scandelous. For early individual shows if i want to binge watch Gotham etc etc I CAN'T. It's enough to drive anyone to piracy. I'm so sick of it. And the prices!!! What is it? $3 an episode? From a network I already pay for? It's so shady.
 I tried again yesterday. Still cant run the HBO apps on my Firestick or Play Station 4. Xfinity is not listed on the supporting partners.

Comcast Customer Service; Theft; Inconsistency,2015-04-01,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,19121,"On March 18, 2015 I attempted to make a payment for $45 to Comcast via their online payment portal. This payment was declined. I immediately made a second, successful payment attempt via Comcast's automated phone system. This second payment was processed successfully and I received a confirmation number; this confirmation number was the only confirmation number I received that day.
 On March 20, 2015, Comcast withdrew the payment from my bank account TWICE. I had $54 in my account at the time, so the double withdrawal overdrew my account. Both payments were returned by my bank and Comcast charged me a $25 return fee for each returned payment.
 On March 30, 2015, Comcast attempted to withdraw one of the payments again. My account was still overdrawn from Comcast's first attempt so this payment was returned again, and Comcast charged me another $25 return fee.
 Also, on March 30, 2015, after realizing what Comcast had done, I called Comcast's customer service line. I was told 1) that the second, unauthorized payment would stop being ""withdrawn"" from my account and 2) all of the return fees that Comcast charged me would be refunded to me by Wednesday, April 1, 2015.
 After being told, on March 30, 2015, that Comcast had cancelled the unauthorized payment, Comcast made another attempt to withdraw the unauthorized amount the very next day. (Tuesday, March 31, 2015). My bank account was still overdrawn, the unauthorized and allegedly ""cancelled"" payment was returned, and I was once again charged a $25 returned payment fee. (For those of you keeping score at home, this constitutes the fourth returned payment fee that Comcast charged me.)
 As of today, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, I have not received any refund. Additionally, I called Comcast's customer service line, again, and spoke to someone named Judy. This time I was told that 1) Comcast customer service agents are not permitted to cancel payments that have already been processed (so whomever I spoke to on March 30 was either sorely mistaken or lying to me about ""canceling the unauthorized payment and refunding my money"" OR ""Judy"" was sorely mistaken or lying to me) and 2) Even thought Comcast declined my attempted internet payment, but somehow charged me for it anyway, I would not be receiving the refund that I was promised.
 ""Judy"" also refused to transfer me to a supervisor. Judy kept interrupting me. As a result, I had to repeat myself multiple times. It was exceedingly frustrating.
 I would like to say that this issue was ultimately resolved. However, the last thing that Judy told me was, ""I will see if my supervisor is available."" Forty minutes later, Judy hung up on me. I did not get to plead my case to a supervisor and I suspect that Judy had no intention of letting me.
 My hopeful objective for this complaint is to receive a refund for each of the four $25 return fees that Comcast charged me and promised to return. The double withdrawal was a result of a mistake made by Comcast, because of that mistake, my account was repeatedly overdrawn. I expect Comcast to remedy this.

Wrongful billing - repeated since December 2013,2015-04-10,Grand Rapids,Michigan,49546,"Comcast continues to bill for equipment I own and no longer lease. I purchased my modem in 2013. I returned my leased modem to Comcast in person and I was assured that billing for it would stop. After 3 calls, it finally did stop. Then it restarted for no apparent reason. I've now gone through that cycle at least 4 additional times. Repeated promises that the problem has been corrected go unfulfilled. Agents have hang up on me a number of times as I attempt to resolve the issue. I need a permanent solution to this illegal billing.

Internet Availability,2015-06-03,Canton,Georgia,30114,"Moved into Comcast area, Canton, Ga and went on line on my cell phone to establish new service. Completed all parts, chose date of install, completed service request. Received a call today stating unable to meet service date of June 7 which is the available date on their website, but offered me June 26th I told them that was not as requested, thus they moved it to June 13. I canceled request for service as they should not let you choose a date then contact you and cancel can you not allow another company to service this area? These people are the worst.

Comcast/Xfinity Internet,2015-06-13,Cottage Grove,Minnesota,55016,"I have had ongoing issues with Comcast internet dating back to September 2014. I have called countless times to report the issues to them and have them troubleshoot the problems. They replaced my modem 5 times since I have signed up and have sent out two technicians. My internet data speeds and performance have never lived up to the outlined performance standards Comcast publishes for more than 30 days. Finally in late May I was transferred to retention where a representative made some additional adjustments to my account and replaced my modem again. I continued to have issues with performance and reported them to their tech support group in early June, since then the performance has lived up to their commitments (not been 30 days yet). Today I received a bill for $190.14, at no point did I authorize my bill to increase as a result of them resolving my issues nor was I ever informed of an increase. This is the second time they have added fraudulent charges to my bill. I expect the $190.14 to be credited to my account, the billing to be corrected back to the normal $45.71 (taxes included) it was over the previous months, and a $150 credit to be issued as a result of the ongoing issues and poor service.

Comcast Data Caps,2015-06-23,Covington,Georgia,30016,"Comcast has issued datacaps in select areas and I find it unfair. The datacap is 300 GB, but I find that unsatisfactory. My main source of entertainment is online providers such as Netflix and Hulu, and watching these at 1080p a few times a day per person in my household (4) has us reaching this cap very quickly. That is followed by an extra 10 dollar charge per 50 gigabytes. Considering this is only in select areas, and comcast plans to expand later, I urge you to stop their actions now before more customers are affected by this.

 issues. I have spent countless hours on the phone and online with tech support to resolve. I have
 asked for several appointments to have my outside lines checked in which no one has showed up. I
 paid a computer IT professional to come to repair my issues but has shown that the issue is directed
 back to Comcast. I have been paying for service that is beyond poor and when I called to cancel my
 service since the price was continuously going up they reduced my rate by locking me into a 2 year
 contract and since then my internet service has been extremely slow. I have exhausted all my options
 other than to file a formal complaint against Comcast for their poor customer service skills and
 inability to resolve my issues. I use my home for business purposes and I can not cancel my internet
 service since now they have contactually locked me into keeping their beyond poor services.",

But, when I looked back at my billing for the last year, I found out that they are charging me an extra 10 dollars every month for that modem which they sent me mistakenly.

Unfair bundles,2015-06-23,Oakland,California,94606,"I have no choice for high speed internet than Comcast. Their prices reflect their monopoly and the only way I can reduce my bill is to buy a 'bundle'. I don't, and have never, owned a land line or television set. I had to buy a tv cable package even though I've never watched cable tv and my bill has got larger as the years go by and if I drop the tv cable service I have to pay even more for internet alone. I periodically call Comcast to remonstrate and/or to ask for a way to reduce my bill but I get nowhere.
 I recently read this piece and believe it to be true: ""Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.""

Several issues,2015-05-01,Lantana,Florida,33462,"I just received a call from the collections department about a past due bill that is not in my name
 ). This was placed on my credit report (collection agency) in 2015 and was removed
 within two days of submitting a dispute. I also returned a letter to the USPS with the name of Alvin
 Chavis and asked to have it returned because my name is not Alvin Chavis. I was informed that
 service would be interrupted because of this. The employee also said the service would be
 interrupted because of a previous bill under somebody else's name (she asked me if they were
 available and I told her she would need to call them on the number that is listed for that customer). I
 have had problems with the service since placing the order (possibly because I did a self install,
 which I connected all the equipment the right way). When I first ordered service I ordered internet
 only (read the pricing and terms, which did not say tv was required) the order was put in as internet
 and tv service. I placed another order for upgraded service and noticed while finding what package I
 wanted the pricing and terms had changed to say internet would require tv service.",

Comcast,2015-05-25,Franklin,Tennessee,37067,"Comcast has implemented usage based billing in the Nashville area in the face of no broadband
 competition. The only local competitor is ATT - their footprint is smaller, services less well developed,
 and in my case not available due to my geographic location. Essentially for me, Comcast has a
 monopoly on high-speed internet services.
 It is egregious they are implementing this cap with no clear justification other than the desire to
 increase their profits as more online services continue to develop. This will stifle innovation, even as
 there is no competition.
 The method by which they are doing this is also problematic. Comcast plans come with an initial data
 cap of 300GB/mo. It offers a $5 discount from your monthly bill to lower your data cap to 5GB/mo.
 However for each 50GB over 300GB, they charge $10. Thus there is also a significant difference
 between increasing and decreasing your data cap.
 Moreover, there are neighter options for a home plan with an increased cap, nor unlimited home
 plans.
 It seems that the inconsistent pricing of data coupled with an existent monopoly is a consumer issue
 worthy of the FCC's investigation.",
Comcast Data Cap,2015-06-23,Lithia Springs,Georgia,30122,"Ever since Comcast started enforcing their data cap I felt that my ability to use the internet has been restricted. It is effecting my ability to use the internet because I have to worry if im going to go over the limit and it effects my choices daily. They don't even offer a plan that doesn't have a data cap. This forced data cap prevents me from watching shows online (Netflix HBO Go) to my hearts content.

Unfair billing practices by Comcast Xfinity,2015-06-23,Springfield,Illinois,62704,"I was pushed by Comcast into signing up for both their Internet service and Cable TV service. I do not use their cable TV service and called them recently to cancel this portion of my service. I was told that if I cancelled with them, I would still pay the exact same price as I presently do for Internet service. I have noticed that my charges have increased from $60 to almost $90 plus taxes and various ancillary fees for these services, one of which I do not use.
 I have tried to discuss this with a support representative but they are not helpful. I would appreciate your assistance in resolving these unfair billing practices as I do not have another reliable option for Internet service at my current address.

Forced to pay for Home Security Services that are inactive bundled with my internet services,2015-04-02,Memphis,Tennessee,38111,"I signed up for Comcast Home Security Services in December 2013 and was told that I had 30 days to cancel. I canceled within those 30 days as documented and recorded in their records however the security charges still have been showing up on my bill for the past 16 months along with the other bundled services. When I call to address this addition I was told that I am still under contract however my security services are inactive. I called in January 2014 and told them that my security services were not working and I wanted to cancel. They scheduled someone to come out that did not show up and when I called to report and proceed with cancelling these services because I miss worked for this no show - I was told that they would give me a $100 gift card for my inconvenience, cancel the services and gave me a few free channels to stay with Comcast Internet and Cable services. They also told me that they have a security plan that does not require the 2 year agreement and I can pay that on a monthly basis. I agreed to the gift card and the monthly plan. The next week their technician no showed again and I called to cancel and express my frustrations once again. I was told at that time that I was still under contract and will be charged 2k for early cancellation. I repeatedly spoke with several representatives since then describing my accounts since the Home Security system was installed. It never worked, it's inactive and I am still paying for it. They continue to bill and threatens me with a early cancellation fee if I cancel when I already canceled over 16 months ago.

Comcast's Deceptive Billing,2015-06-28,Pontiac,Michigan,48342,"It was not that long ago that I filed a complaint against Comcast for the way in which they bill you for their services. I am a senior living on a fixed income. This is my tenth year of receiving services from this company. There has never been a year that I have not had to get with them on unfair or deceptive billing. When I complained the last time, they set my payment for 110.94 a month. After explaining for years, they know not only I, but thousands of their customers are on fixed incomes, therefore to take money from other financial obligations will most often result in utility shutoffs. I discussed the fact that I could not have them changing my payment in the middle of the month. They assured me my payment would be 110.94 until the promotion had ended. All of a sudden for the month of June, I received a bill for $133.68. The extra $22.74 goes a long way in my household. When asked about the increase, they stated I was being charged for not having an ECO Bill. The ten years I have been with this company, I have never heard of such. When I receive my bill, the only thing I look at is how much I owe. Their representative stated, all I had to do was go on the internet and signup for the ECO Bill and they would not charge the extra $5.00. My question is, if Comcast was interested in helping their customers, why not put a check box on their billing giving individuals the opportunity to check yes or no if they want to opt out of ECO billing and save themselves $5.00 monthly. This complaint is being submitted on behalf of all Seniors, Disable and the handicapped who cannot see or have the skills to use computers. I am sure there are millions. Comcast is profiting from the unfortunate. I am asking the FCC to persuade this company to make opting out of a paper billing so those who have limited incomes can also afford their services. When I suggested seeking services elsewhere, the representative stated, ""They all do the same thing."" How can this be fair? As a footnote, I paid the 133.68 this month, but if they do not remove the $5.00 charge next month. I may have to shut everything down and find another form of entertainment.
 Sincerely,
 ","

Comcast billing issues,2015-06-24,Milpitas,California,95035,"With regular service disruption and complains for over 2 years, Comcast has done nothing to either fix their service or to compensate me in the bills.
 Moreover, I receive downright rude and threatening calls about service disruption.
 They call me at all odd hours and when I finally answered and told them ""This is not a convenient time"", their response was ""You answered the call""!
 How is this kind of obnoxious behavior acceptable?

False contract repersentation,2015-05-15,Boulder,Colorado,80304,"My neighbor has Xfinity/Comcast service for phone, Internet and cable TV. I was on the phone
 helping her drop Internet service (only¬) and trying to find out how much she would pay monthly for
 the reduced service.
 I was told she had to pay $180 to be released from her contract, a contract that she didn’t remember,
 but that Comcast claimed prevented her from downgrading her service for three years.
 After a half-hour of back and forth, the representative admitted that my neighbor had only been
 “presented” with the contract, but she had never “accepted” it. At this point I was put on hold and
 transferred to another representative, who, after more back and forth we may have given us the
 information we were requesting, I say “may” because we are not sure. All we were trying to learn was
 what would be her monthly bill if she dropped her internet service and kept her cable TV and phone
 service the same as it is now. This should be a simple, easily answered question. What we heard
 from the second representative was convoluted and not entirely clear.
 I interpret the statement, “You have a contract that says you must pay $180 to drop service” as
 fraudulent behavior on Comcast’s part. I cannot prove that it is standard operating procedure, but it
 did not feel like it was a singular incident. It felt like the representative was trained to mislead callers
 about non-existent “contracts” when they sought information about dropping service.
 In addition, I think that it was completely unreasonable for Comcast to take an hour to answer a
 simple question about the cost of reduced service. The delay, the questions, and the passing us to
 another representative felt like an intentional practice on Comcast’s part to discourage individuals
 from reducing service. I recently had another, entirely positive, swift experience when I called about
 initiating service with Comcast.",
"threat of shutting off service of phone,internet and TV",2015-06-28,Sharon,Connecticut,6069,"I was given a special price of $55.40 for my comcast service. I am on a fixed budget, I am disabled as my husband is also. I have to go south due to my cardiovascular collagen disease non-specific, because the winters are to harsh for me, and I can't move,and I am isolated. I don't drive, little to none. I don't have cell service in my locality and I have to have access to a phone and internet for communication, safety and health needs. I returned to CT May 3rd, 2015 I did not have any service in my home no internet or phone. I called and I was told service was on. On May 11,2015 it was discovered that my service was never activated.
 I rec'd a bill for $183.59. I have been working with Elizabeth Calbarese I think that is her name, (she is supposed to be from the corporate executive headquarters )who gave me the package for $55.40, which began on August 2014, elizabeth gave it to me for 2 years. I spoke with on occasion concerning my phone and that i was going to go on seasonal service and I did not want it to affect my current plan. She assured me that it wouldn't. I received my next bill for 106.57 plus the prior balance of 183.59 (But I had a credit from seasonal advance payments,credit was $3.85.) I have called Elizabeth many many times with no response. I am sending this letter that will hopefully be attached or mailed to you. Now I receive a threat of turning off my service. I am disabled I don;t have cell service and If they shut off my service I have no phone or way to communicate in any way.
 Comcast is the most terrible company I have ever had to deal with. there is no consistency,they are not honest and it does appear that they have a monopoly. GO to the comcast web-site look at all the complaints from Many, Many states. Now they are talking about merging with Time warner. This also can not happen. The consumers are trapped. Dealing with Comcast is a very time consuming exhausting experience. In all honesty i have been dealing with issues since 2008, static on the line,no service, dropped service, no phone. I had every repair man come and replace all my connections, one of them actually told me, (I will not release his name as there job is in jeopardy, but the problem exists outside,they need new wiring and replacement of old material etc)it was outside issue. When I call Comcast they have in their file that this was the consumers fault. This occurred every time. They are an underhanded company,they get the consumer from every angle. They block other companies,they are sneaky,not trustworthy and should not be allowed to merge with Time Warner.
 Please someone help me. I am also sending this to the Disability association AADP. Than you for your time

unresponsive calls to customer service regarding wifi hotspots,2015-06-17,Lemont,Illinois,60439,"I have been attempting for over 3 weeks to have wifi hotspots ( which I am entitiled to with my xfinity wifi service )installed on my laptop. I have spent over 15 hours on the phone with technicians who after hours on the phone decide that they are not qualified to help me. They then escalate the call and say someone will call me back. No one ever calls me. I have made more than a half dozen calls to their customer service department and they, too, say they will have a technician call me back. We have even made appointments for them to call me....but, they never do.

Fraud,2015-06-18,Jacksonville,Florida,32221,"Greetings.
 On June 5th 2015 unauthorized activity occurred on my Comcast account. On Saturday June 6, 2015 I agreed to make arrangements to pay $102.05.
 On June 9,10,& 11, Comcast has tried to take out the amount I have agreed to pay on the 13th of June which developed a $96 fee from my bank. On June 12th Comcast has tried to pull from my account. Because of this problem , I paid $105 to Comcast on Sunday June 14th instead of Saturday June 13th. The following Tuesday , June 16 my services were suspended. I spoke with a representative to restore my services and I was told that they needed my checking information to do so , which I did not agree with because of the unnecessary activities taken place on my bank account from Comcast. In result, I now have to create a new bank account and cancel my services with Comcast. I need clarification before i cancel .
 Please & Thank you

Deceptive Billing Practices,2015-06-30,Dallas,Georgia,30132,"In November 2014, I placed a call to Comcast to report that my invoice was not transparent and continued increasing well beyond the initial agreed upon amount. A representative advised that in order to decrease billing I needed to add phone service to the bundle. I agreed to do this, but stated I would not use the phone service. The representative stated my monthly bill would be $142.99 moving forward. Several months later, I noticed that my bill is $206.00 monthly on average and not the previously agreed upon amount. Upon calling Comcast, I was told that the previously representative in November had not applied the program correctly resulting in the higher charges and that Comcast would not credit my future bills for the overpaid amounts nor will they apply the lower amount for future or current bills. After escalating the problem to a supervisor, I was still denied a credit for the agreed upon amount a Comcast representative offered to me.

Poor Service from Comcast,2015-05-31,Duluth,Georgia,30096,"I am providing feedback because of my recent experiences with Comcast. I am an extremely
 disappointed first time customer. I first called to establish service on May 19, 2015 and unfortunately
 still do not have anything setup. I have recently downgraded and canceled several times due to poor
 customer service and broken promises from managers that technicians would come to setup my
 service. I have missed work on 5/24 and 5/26 waiting on a technician to come to appointments setup
 by Comcast and they have not shown up on two occasions. A technician came on 5/30 and told me
 that he did not have time to setup an outlet and wasn't aware that is what was needed. I contacted
 Comcast while the technician was still at my home and the manager heard the technician tell me that
 he did not have time and could not setup the outlet because he had other appointments. The
 manager was appalled and said this is not the way Comcast does business and he apologized to
 me. He again talked me into keeping the service and promised that he would have someone to come
 out by end of business day or Sunday. It is 5pm today on 5/31 and a technician has not come to
 setup my service. I've called three times and was reassured that a technician would come out today.
 My urgency to get internet is school work that I've had to go other places to get done due to no
 internet service in my home. I put $150 deposit on to establish service and when I wanted to cancel, I
 was told that I could go to the service center to be refunded. I went to the service center to be
 refunded on 5/27 and waited 45 mins in line, I was told that Comcast does not give cash refunds and
 I should receive my reimbursement via mail in 6 to 8 weeks. I was talked into keeping my service
 while there and was guaranteed that a technician would come out to set everything up. This has been
 a nightmare for me and I just want to get internet service and treated like a valuable customer.",

Comcast / Xfinity overcharging for internet / internet cap,2015-05-23,Dacula,Georgia,30019,"I have been using Comcast for my Cable / Internet for the past couple of years and have noticed a
 sudden increase of overages and charges for Internet usage without any changes in our household
 Internet habits. When speaking with customer service, they say that they can confirm that our usage
 has increased, but cannot verify to us how they are able to measure this increase. We also find it
 interesting while researching this issue on the Internet that there are many other customers that seem
 to experiencing very similar issues of overcharges. And also during the same time line. I want my
 Internet provider, Comcast, to be able to give me a detailed accounting of my usage so I can address
 my usage in my household, or address the possibility that their measurement system is flawed. If it is
 on their end, I have then been overcharged hundreds of dollars over the course of the last six months

Overage Charges,2015-06-24,Glencoe,Alabama,35905,"We have been a Comcast customer for years and had unlimited internet usage until the last year, now we have a limit. This was all without our agreement or acknowledgement. We've dealt with the annoying phone calls letting us know we're close to our limit for months now but it recently got much worse. Our usual $80 bill was $250! Logging onto our account we saw that Comcast charged us $170 in overage fees. The first 3 reps said it would be taken off as a courtesy. When it still wasn't resolved I contacted them again to get a different story. They were very quick to tell us to stop watching Netflix if we didn't want to pay the higher bills. Not only would they not adjust our bill they suggested we upgrade service and use their version of Netflix to keep from going over. If my husband wasn't in grad school and needing the internet I wouldn't worry with it. But as it stands we are set to send an entire week's pay to Comcast to cover fees. How is this fair to us or Netflix? Why are we being punished by not buying a more expensive package? The whole thing just doesn't seem right at all. Please help.

Comcast Data Caps,2015-06-29,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,"Last year, Comcast notified us that we were going to have data caps of 300gb per month. These caps were only applied to certain markets and we happened to be stuck in one of the affected areas. Comcast 'graciously' allowed us to have three months where we could go over the caps per year. We used our three months in 2014 but have yet to receive any credits this year. Our monthly bill should only be approximately $55 per month and sometimes we are paying twice and even three times as much because we are not receiving the waivers that we were promised.
 My wife and I recently made the switch to Comcast business service which is significantly slower and more expensive. Even that process was a hassle. The first sales representative that we spoke with lied about not being able to give us the lowest price that was being advertised. She repeatedly stated that the offer was no longer available in our area. I checked their website two weeks later and the offer was still being advertised. I finally was able to speak with someone that would sell me the least expensive service.
 Now that I no longer have Comcast residential service, I would like to see if it is possible to be reimbursed for the three months that we went over on our data caps.
 Thank you,

Comcast charging over $600 for data,2015-06-08,Marietta,Georgia,30067,"We have owned comcast at home now since November 2014. Our monthly rate is $89.99 for 105mbps service. My family (my wife and I) averages about 320GB's per month which in turn has comcast charge an additional $10 for 50gb past the 300gb limit per month. We are fine with that.
 We got 3 months of ""free overages"" which I kept track of for January, February and March. I monitor my network at home very excessively (I am a network engineer at work) and see that I average 320GB per month which should set our bill to about $99.99 per month for Comcast.
 On the month of May, Comcast debited $260 from our account and did not explain. We have spent countless hours trying to talk to someone for an explanation (over 50 hours of phone time). According to my data, my network did *NOT* exceed 300gb that month. After dozens of calls, Cocmast opened a ""case to determine if the data was coming from my modem"". Two weeks later, I got a call back saying ""we have verified that all data has been coming from your modem and there will be no refund"".
 According to their statistics, we used over 1100GB of data for April. In order to do that, we would need to have had 4 different devices streaming HD content every second of the month. The only things my wife and I do is check email, facebook and play a few games. We have never used that much data in that period of time. In fact, I was out of town for work for TWO weeks that month and there were NO computers at home during those weeks accessing the network.
 As of today (June 8th), Comcast is now charging us $360 for the month of May with no warning or explanation once again. We have called numerous people in regards to this with no answer and debited our accounts anyway.
 As of today, the service is canceled (hopefully) as we do not have the money to continue. Comcast refuses to explain what was downloaded and when. They have only said ""we see the data came from your modem"" and that is it.
 Please help us. We have no internet service in our area and have no choice but to use a dial-up connection moving forward until ATT installs service in our area.

Comcast cramming,2015-04-27,Wilmington,Delaware,19803,"Comcast has on two occasions overcharged my account by claiming I had services that were never requested.
 1. In late 2014 Comcast began to charge me for a DVR rented from it, that I never received nor requested. Comcast charged me for 4-5 months for rental of a DVR that was not received by me. When I complained that the device was not ordered nor received, they conducted an investigation and determined that they were correct. They continued the charge. I complained again and they sent a tech to my home who confirmed that I had no DVR.
 2. Three months later Comcast added ""Blast Internet"" to my account without requesting permission. There was no order for this service. I requested removal, which was promised but NOT removed. I was charged again the next month. I complained again. The status is pending.

Comcast Speed Issues,2015-05-18,Boca Raton,Florida,33434,"Consumer is dissatisfied with her Comcast (internet) service. She upgraded to a 25Mbps speed for
 an extra $10 per month. Comcast offered her a $5 per month rebate for using paperless billing. Her
 speed is slower than ever before and Comcast blames it on her modem, which is older. When she
 does a speed test she gets 3Mbps download/1Mbps upload. She is going to purchase a new modem
 but she does not believe it will fix the problem. As a resolution, she would like her bill to be stable at
 $24 per month. She would also like the speed that she signed up for. ***CTR359-phone***

 This morning, June 10th, I am unable to do the simplest task on my computer, for example, read and
 delete email. The speed I am receiving at the current time tested at 1.12 megabits per second. The
 performance package that I am paying for is supposed to be 25 megabits per second. My speed test
 results are variable but the highest result I have had is 10 megabits per second. Comcast does not
 seem able to provide me reliable ""high speed"" service. I am sure I am not the only customer being
 defrauded by Comcast and I have no intention of taking them to court. It would be good if people in
 my area had a real choice of providers. I, likewise, have no intention of letting their technicians near
 my equipment because it works perfectly all the time. It is the service that Comcast provides that
 doesn't work much of the time. I don't know why their ""highly trained technicians"" can't fix what is
 wrong with Comcast's service. What I want is what I am paying for High Speed Internet Service. In
 addition to paying for internet service I pay $70 a month for cable TV which I pay through my
 maintenance. For this amount I get basic service. The choice of programming for that large amount of
 money is so paltry that I don't watch TV most of the time.

 This morning, when I wrote the complaint, the speed that I received 1.18 megabits per second was
 with the new modem that I purchased for $75 because Comcast's representatives told me that I
 would not be able to receive high speed with the modem that I had. I purchased a new high speed
 modem that supposedly gets 343 megabits per second and I still did not get high speed. The highedt
 speed that it tested at was 10 megabits per second and most of the time it got a little more than 3
 megabits per second. After I made this complaint the new modem that I have started to reboot itself
 every few seconds. I became alarmed that something would break and I called support to tell them to
 (b) (6)
 stop fiddling with my modem. I was told that no one was doing anything to my modem. I removed the
 new modem and reattached the old modem which worked immediately. It tested at 3.5 megabits per
 second. I have no idea what to do to get high speed internet but at this point I don't think that I will get
 it from Comcast.

Overcharged for underperforming services,2015-06-12,Littleton,Colorado,80123,"I've had broadband internet since the 90s. I was one of the very first professional gamers to ever get paid to play and to travel. Since then, my field has been constantly held back, strangled and corrupted by the simple fact that ISP's in the U.S. have failed to upgrade & maintain their infrastructure as they have so vehemently demanded money from us for. Countries like Korea, China, and all of Europe are light years ahead of the U.S. with regards to telecommunications, and even e-sports - a massive economy that can only help the U.S. and will undoubtedly become an olympic sport one day - is being held back by greedy executives at companies like Comcast, Time Warner, Insight Cable, etc. are spending money on building their profit-churning machines instead of actually upgrading our infrastructure as promised. My personal life goals have suffered due to these assholes, and I'm sure a lot of others have as well. Time to fire them and make fiber available everywhere in the US

Comcast Internet Pricing,2015-06-24,Dearborn,Michigan,48124,"Our bill has been raised by about $30 this month. When I called to ask why, they said that a promotion ended. I keep records of all bills, agreements, and such, and I was told when I last changed my plan that it was not a promotion. I was told by the Comcast representative ""Sorry about that, but even if that is true, I cannot change it now.""
 Basically they just raised my bill by $30 for no reason whatsoever, and I cannot do anything about it other than cancel. However, since Comcast is the only provider in the area of internet speeds that I need for my work, I am effectively left with no option but to put up with them doing whatever they want with my bill, however illegal it may be.

Comcast is a downright awful service provider.,2015-06-12,Redmond,Washington,98053,"Comcast is one of the worst service providers I have ever used. I pay for 150Mbit speeds, but receive no more than 70Mbit peak no matter what time of day, under BEST case conditions. The majority of the time speeds are under 40Mbit and it is not uncommon to see speeds plummet to a sub-100KB/sec speed around 8pm PT when usage is at it's peak.
 Comcast is ruining the most wonderful technological advancement our species has ever developed and I hate them for it. Seriously, I hate Comcast and if I had ANY other option for broadband internet I would switch immediately, even if the service was for the same speeds and twice the money I currently pay Comcast; just so I would no longer have to participate in funding their assault on innovation.

Internet/Phone Billing Services,2015-04-08,Lancaster,Pennsylvania,17601,"During the second month of new service with Comcast, my account was double billed. Every item on the normal billed was doubled in the amount that was owed, thereby creating a bill that was twice the normal bill. I called on 3/9/15, and spent almost 2 hours on the phone with various customer service representatives but no one could help. The only response I received was that this was something they had never seen before and it would need to be investigated. I did not receive any return call. I called Comcast again on 3/11/15 and spoke with a representative named Denise (no one has a direct line, so you can't call anyone back) and she said she would take care of it by submitting a report to have the account investigated. She made several notes and was to give me a $9.50 credit for a late fee I was about to incur. The double billing has still not been resolved. I have called an additional 4 times, spent an additional 5 hours on the phone with various Comcast representatives, but cannot get it resolved. Most representatives cannot even find my account. If they can, they cannot pull up the statement in February that shows the double billing. How can a company stay in business with no customer service? How I can be double billed but I have to waste my time and frustration in constantly calling? I don't understand how Comcast is allowed to get away with conducting business in this manner.

Inconsistent and poor internet performance,2015-05-09,Marlton,New Jersey,5053,"I am paying for an internet service that features up to 100mbps in downstream speed. Over the last
 week, downstream speed has often been below 1Mbps well below what I am paying for. Upstream
 performance has been consistent and satisfactory. Comcast has been unable to rectify via remote
 means and now wants me to buy a service plan for $4.95/month in order for me to avoid charges for
 an at home service tech call. I already pay nearly $200.00/month, including Comcast provided
 wireless modem and they are telling I have to pay extra in an effort to attain a level of service I am
 already paying for and not presently receiving . Please note that I have no other options to obtain

300GB/month data cap 'trial' for several years now,2015-04-29,Marietta,Georgia,30062,"Comcast has been 'trialling' a 300GB/month data cap for several years now and I want to file a complaint about it. As more and more services become available over the internet, the 300GB/month data cap is far too low. We are a family of 4 people (2 adults & 2 kids) and it is very easy to exceed this data cap every month from using services like Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime Video for movies, Youtube for videos, and electronic video game distribution from Microsoft. For example a new console game download alone is close to 20% of the monthly 'cap'.
 It is deeply disturbing that they charge an 'overage fee' for exceeding this cap considering that a large component of the data usage (movie & entertainment) is related to services that are in direct competition with Comcast. I believe that their only motivation for the monthly data cap and subsequent 'overage fee' is to stifle competitive services.

Installation Charges,2015-06-21,Elgin,Illinois,60124,"We recently moved and chose comcast as a service provider for tv and internet. We used to have ATT. A representative for comcast that we spoke to to order service said it would be 60 for a tech to come out and install services. I agreed with this price. He came out and installed said services for tv and internet. We got our first bill and they charged us 160 something for installation. 30 per outlet and cable boxes. We pay 10 per month per box. I called customer service billing and credit department regaurding this and he stated we said it would be ok if it was 30 extra per outlet or box. I spoke to family members and they said they never agreed with a 30 charge. I asked to speak to a supervisor and had to wait 15 or so minutes to do so. We spoke and I repated my whole story to him. He offered to take 25 off. I told him the lady who sold us s evice said 60 for installation and that was the max I was going to pay. I had enough of not getting anywhere so I said thanks and have a nice day, I don't need anything else. I'm trying to get this resolved before July 1st because that is the due date for this $330 bill.

Shady Internet Billing Practices from Comcast,2015-06-24,Richmond,Virginia,23220,"i moved to richmond virgnia in January of 2014.
 Upon moving into my apartment, i was already registered with Verizon high-speed internet.
 When i discovered that the fastest speed they were able to provide me was 7.1mbps, i decided to seek another provider that could offer me more for a similar price.
 I found that Comcast was the only other provider for my building.
 When i signed up with Comcast they offered me 25mbps at $29.99 for the first year, where it would then increase to $44.99.
 I accepted this offer and all was well.
 This past June, when i moved to a new home in the same city, i sought to transfer my existing account to the new address.
 While on the phone with my customer service agent, they offered me an additional promotion where for just $5 i would have an increased internet speed of 50mbps, local television, and an active HBO GO account.
 I accepted the offer because i truly wanted faster internet, i wasn’t concerned at all about the television bonus.
 I was also promised a 30-day satisfaction wherein they would revert my bill if i was unsatisfied — no questions asked.
 When i inquired about the necessary cable equipment, i was informed that my new pricing structure would not come into effect until i obtained and activated the new cable box.
 After obtaining the cable box, activating, and testing my newly increased internet speeds, i learned that they had not actually increased at all.
 I was still receiving the same speed of 25mbps.
 I called Comcast to inquire, and they insisted that they had never promised me a faster internet speed than the one i currently had.
 According to Comcast, they do not offer a 50mbps speed, only a 105mbps.
 Outraged, i insisted that they cancel the current plan and revert me back, as promised.
 The agent pleaded that i give him an extra business day to further research a different offer wherein i could obtain faster internet speeds without increasing my bill tremendously.
 He also continued to remind me of my still existing 30-day guarantee.
 Because he was a personable agent, unlike most i’d spoken to previously, i accepted his challenge and gave him a business day to contact me with a new, possible solution.
 Tomorrow came, and the agent did not call.
 He never called.
 I waited a week, in case he might try to reach me with a solution but the phone never rang.
 Finally, i contacted Comcast to address the issue and cancel the existing offer and revert to my previous bill.
 They said that they could not do that.
 I believe very specifically they stated that, “the current promotions available to us do not allow us to revert your bill to its original status”.
 I asked to speak to a manager where i received an additional agent citing the very same problem.
 They insisted that the only thing they could do, was revert my account back to the previous plan, but i would then be required to pay the base price of $64.99.
 Clearly, that is more than i was paying before and is not at all the definition of a 30-day risk-free satisfaction guarantee.
 I was very vocal about my dissatisfaction with their offer and their inability to honor a system they put in place to create a sense of security to its customers when being offered new packages over the phone.
 I did not seek out these offers, they were presented to me by an effort on the part of Comcast.
 When i expressed a desire to complain and seek a higher authority to rectify this issue, the agent was very quick to drop the price of said package from $64.99 to $56.99 based on a “one-time offer”.
 While this was still not the price i desired, i found it very odd how easy it was for this agent to simply lower the price of a package i had just previously been told was non-negotiable.
 Dissatisfied, i requested to speak to a higher representative where i could voice a formal complaint about the issue.
 It was becoming clear to me that i was stuck paying this fixed price of $49.99 for services i never wanted or else pay an additional $15 to have them removed.
 The agent was very hesitant to forward me to a higher representative and insisted that she could solve the problem herself.
 She copied down my phone number and informed me that she would call me back momentarily when she had a solution.
 After perhaps 20-minutes or so, i received a phone call from the representative stating that she was able to revert my bill back to its previous state and that my payments now and in the future would remain at the $44.99 price point.
 Through this experience, it is clear to me that Comcast spends much of their time bullying customers into television packages under false pretense and promise of higher quality products the consumer may already have.
 This was not the first, or even the tenth time i had been contacted by Comcast seeking that i upgrade my account to a television or telephone package.
 Then they offer a 30-day satisfaction, but they’re quick to avoid mentioning that the guarantee has nothing to do with the price you’re currently paying for said services. It only guarantees that they will have the ability to up-charge you to return to a service package you once had.
 After this experience, i will be petitioning Verizon to offer FIOS high-speed in my area in an effort to avoid doing further business with Comcast, but currently i have no other available options.
 Thank you for your time.

 Hi
 On June 26, 2015 i was contacted by someone who addressed themselves as a Comcast employee in reference to my FCC complaint.
 They apologized for my troubles and as a gesture of good will, they promised to upgrade my Comcast account from ""performance"" internet at 25mbps to ""blast"" internet at 105mbps for the next two years at a promotional price of $44.99 (the same price i am currently paying).
 However, i am currently on the phone with comcast still trying to figure out why my internet speeds have not increased.
 The customer service agent on the phone with me right now says that my account still has the ""performance"" internet package and that there are no notes indicating that my internet package was ever changed, adjusted, or even noted.
 Once again, i was sold false hope."
Comcast Refusing to Honor Internet Rate,2015-06-25,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,"On June 12, 2015 I signed up for Comcast internet service for the first time (new customer) via the Comcast website. I signed up for a promotional internet offer for their ""Performance"" package (25 mbps) for $24.99 for the first 12 months.
 On June 22, 2015 I received my first bill for the service and noticed I was being charged $66.95 for the internet service instead of $24.99 as stated when I signed up. I called Comcast to address this issue and have had limited success in getting it resolved. After no fewer than 8 calls to Comcast customer support, I was redirected between the sales, online sales, billing, retention, and technical support departments, with each one telling me variations of the following: ""the offer is no longer available, [our department] can't fix this issue you need to contact [other department], we don't see the offer in our system so we cannot change your price, we can offer you another [more expensive] bundled internet and TV package, we can offer you a [slower] service for the same price"", and so forth.
 I have spent 5+ hours on the phone with various departments at Comcast and have still had no success in getting them to honor the rate I was told when I signed up for the service. I refuse to pay $41 more per month than I was told. I was either deliberately misled about the price of the service or Comcast is simply refusing to honor their own offers, either of which is unacceptable.
 I have attached screenshots of the offer I signed up for from the Comcast website, the terms and conditions of the offer, and another screenshot showing that the offer is for my address, clearly showing that the offer was valid at the time I signed up, for the specific service I signed up for, and offered at my specific address. Please do something with this information as seen fit.
 Thank you,

Throttling/drastic reduction of speeds,2015-06-25,San Jose,California,95121,"The internet has become unusable after normal usage. We pay for 4 or 6 megabits download and now we are receiving anywhere from 0.5 to 1 Mb per second. Streaming a video requires constant buffering when prior to this we could load 720p videos smoothly.

Comcast/Xfinity: Poor internet connection speed and poor customer service,2015-05-08,San Francisco,California,94114,"To whom it may concern:
 I have internet service with Comcast, and I am writing to let you know about my frustration with both
 the internet service and the customer service.
 I called Comcast customer service today because I am having internet speed issues; this is an issue
 that I have had ever since I started with Comcast, and in the past, none of the tech support people
 has truly resolved the issue for me. I had to make 3 calls today:
 - Call #1: I was working with a tech support person; we were doing some tests, and he suggested
 that the issue could be the modem, and I should consider getting a modem replaced. He said he
 would call me if we were disconnected during testing. I explained to him that I was calling on a VoIP
 line and gave him my cell phone number. He asked me to hang up, and he will call me on my cell
 phone. He never called back.
 - Call #2: After not receiving a call-back from tech support guy #1, I called again. After going through
 the numerous voice-prompt menu options, my call was picked up and disconnected/dropped for no
 apparent reason, and I was forced to call a third time.
 - Call #3: The third call was most the infuriating. The tech support lady had a poorly command of
 English, and she clearly didn't know what she was doing. She put me on hold repeatedly while she
 was trying to figure out what to do. I explained to her that I already went through the testing during
 Call #1, and I just want to find out how to get the modem replaced. She finally figured out how to
 send the modem and told me that I would need to pay $15 for shipping. I challenged her on the
 shipping charge: I pay a monthly fee to rent the modem from Comcast, and it make no sense that I
 would have to pay for shipping for a replacement if the equipment Comcast is renting to me is
 defective. At this point, I was absolutely fed up with her incompetence, and I demanded to speak with
 her supervisor. I asked her specifically when I should expect a call from her supervisor, and I was
 told it would be within 30 minutes. Guess what? I didn't get a call from the supervisor.
 I am very frustrated with Comcast for the following reasons:
 1. Poor internet connection: Comcast/Xfinity brags about the speed of its service constantly on TV.
 It sure would be nice if the company actually delivers on what it claims.
 2. Poor customer service: Comcast customer service and tech support people are poorly trained and
 not customer-centric. Why should any customer have to make 3 calls in one day, and still not have
 the issue resolved?
 Furthermore, I think it is ridiculous that I am being asked to pay for shipping on the replacement
 modem. If the modem that Comcast is renting me is defective, then why I am responsible for the
 shipping of the replacement modem?
 I would like to ask you to investigate these poor business practices at Comcast.
 Regards,

The problem is that this is my own modem. I have NEVER had a comcast modem. The letter also says to call them anytime, however, once you navigate the phone tree, I get a message saying our office is now closed. After doing some research online, this is a common issue with Comcast, they are looking to fleece their customers hoping they will simply take this sort of abuse.

Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices,2015-04-15,Hattiesburg,Mississippi,39402,"In August, 2014, I moved to Mississippi and obtained service with Comcast. The service was for their 19.99 internet package. They asked to switch me to paperless billing, but they told me that I could just set up autopay for the $19.99. Today, I came home to find my Internet had been disconnected due to non-payment, even though the autopay continued to go out. I called Comcast who never contacted me, who explained that I was exceeding the package, which was not explained as a possibility; and they indicated that they assumed that I had been logging into the account even though the autopay kept coming. According to Comcast, they felt I must know there was an issue and not be calling but continuing to pay the autopay. 120.00 was required to reinstate the account and a 1 hour 20 minute phone call. At this point, I now have Internet but whomever I spoke to was not able to change my account to the 29.99 level that would be adequate. Instead, they attempted to ""transfer"" me but hung up on me. Why is this unfair and deceptive trade practices? I was encouraged to go paperless. The autopay through them kept being received yet no one contacted me to advise there was an overage for 3 months, which resulted in this astronomical charge. This system is set up to allow them to take advantage of folks as they try to create revenue at the expense of customer service much less service. I would urge that you address these practices with them as they contravene any standard billing practices and could adversely impact consumers, whose credit could potentially be ruined as a result of these ""transparently"" revenue generating efforts to not follow through despite having contact information necessary to obtain the funds owed before the overage became so consequential.

Complaint about service provided by Comcast/Xfinity,2015-06-06,Lafayette,Indiana,47909,"Recently purchased a modem that is listed on Comcast's compatible devices. Since then my internet connection speed is significantly lower than advertised, I get constant signal degradation and have to call to get a ""refresh"" signal sent at least once a week. When I called 6/6/2015 to speak with a representative I asked if this is because I purchased my own device and explained I had no issues when I had a leased device. I was told ""Well, if it was working when you leased the device, maybe you should switch back.""
 I'm very upset about this. I feel that they should not throttle my internet because I'm not paying to lease a device that gives them a competitive advantage in the market.
 Leased Comcast/Xfinity modems offer Wifi to Comcast customers through a second network. Any customer who logs in using their comcast credentials can use the modem that I am leasing to connect to Comcast's network, and at times, the connection speed is faster through this. It should not be legal to charge $10 a month when I'm giving them (inadvertently) a free wifi hotspot for any of their customers to use, and surely if a device is listed as ""compatible"" I should expect to get the same level of service and functionality using it, as one of their own devices.

I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right. Big Corporations lie and cheat people and think nobody will stop them. Have they no shame?

Contract Cancellation Fees and Unauthorized Changes,2015-04-18,Des Plaines,Illinois,60016,"On June 26, 2013 we have called to cancel our contract and were told about cancellation fees, however Customer Service representative offered to transfer existing service for the duration of the original contract (remaining 3 months). Nonetheless without disclosing the Representative renewed our contract for additional 24 months without our knowledge.
 Yet again on 10/22/2013 we called customer service and all we wanted to do at the time is to add Basic Cable TV. Yet again, we were misinformed as to what transpires when adding a basic service. We were absolutely not disclosed that adding simple TV service would renew/add secondary contract .
 Moreover, while discussing the matter after words with several different business customer service representatives we were informed that Comcast Business does not offer nor support Cable TV in the residential house under business account, therefore it was never supposed to be installed; furthermore, additional contract was executed.
 Based on arguments listed above we file for:
 1. DEFINITVE TERMINATION OF CONTRACT #1 (Id# 6474396) from June 2013 to expire June 2015 WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES AND FEES.
 2. Since we were never suppose to be provided with TV at the Residential House and were not disclosed that additional contract shall take affect we file for TERMINATION WITHOUT ANY FEES AND PENALTIES OF CONTRACT #2 (ID#6871464).

COMCAST NIGHTMARE,2015-06-13,Miramar,Florida,33027,"Called Comcast May 5th to set up new service, they said they would be sending a technician. So far so good:
 1st appointment: Tech tells me he can not connect the service and he will call supervisor to come and take a look
 2nd appointment: Supervisor comes to house and tells me that I need an ""MDU"" line. He says he will have someone call me to make this speacial intallation appointment.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call them: Said what happened and that supervisor was going to have someone call me to make appointment for the MDU line hook up but no one ever called me to make the appointment. They tell me not to worry that they will have someone come out to do it.
 3rd Appointment: Another Tech comes out and tells me again he can't connect it and he will call the supervisor.
 I get on the phone with the supervisor (Olaf is his name) and he says ""Oh it's you again? No one ever called you? Let me send the email again so they can call you"".
 NO ONE EVER CALLS ME
 I call again comacast and now ask to speak to a superviso, who apologizes for the trouble and makes an appointment to connect the MDU line hook up.
 4th Appointment: The guy shows up but has a problem entering my neighborhood gate and says he will be back in 1 hour.
 NEVER SHOWS UP.
 I call Comcast again and ask to speak to another Supervisor.
 He apologizes and tells me he will have someone call me to make an appointment for the MDU line.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call comcast again and make sure they have my right phone number (which I know they do because they called me many times to confirm the first appointment I had) and ask to again speak to a Supervisor.
 He tells me he is sorry, he will have someone call me.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call again, comcast says there is a long wait on the phone that I can choose to have comcast call me back and not loose my place in line. The machine says they will be calling me back in the next 6-10 minutes.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call again and ask to speak to a supervisor who now tells me that my account is disconnected and that he needs to have tech set it up again before they can even talk about making the MDU line hook up connections.
 He puts me on wait while he contacts sale department.
 I'm on hold for 30 minutes until the call drops.
 I still don't have service and it has been over a month that they already charged and and have never connected or resolved anything.
 This is a disgrace of a company and customer service.
 I will forever discourage anyone from using comcast.

Unfair Billing Practices regarding Comcast,2015-06-23,Delray Beach,Florida,33484,"To Whom It Concerns:
 In September of 2014 I opened an account with Comcast for Internet services. I found a promotional deal on their own website for 50Mbps Internet ""Blast"". I signed up after I had to argue that the deal was indeed advertised on Comcast. Once I had my account opened everything was okay up until I moved. In April of 2015 I moved to an address that still supports Comcast Internet. It is widely advertised online and TV commercials that moving your services with Comcast will be the ""easiest"" part of your move.
 However, once I contacted Comcast and notified them I was moving from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Delary Beach, Florida I was told that I could NOT move my services. The easiest option was to close my original account (account # ) and open a new account, with a new account number. I thought this would be easy enough. The representative said that I could still get the same package as before but that my rate of $39.99 a month would not be an option to keep. I was forced to pay $49.99 a month for the same services just because I moved to another city in Florida about 20-30 minutes away. I did not believe this was a fair practice but my only other option if I wanted to pay the same rate of $39.99 was to add Cable TV to my plan. I did not want to include Cable TV as part of my package. I did not want to bundle and pay for a service that I would not use.
 So for the same amount of service I have to pay an additional 10 dollars a month or I must add more services that I do not want. Then after 12 months Comcast would increase my bill even more. I do not find this to be in the best interest of subscribers to Comcast. I have been very unhappy with Comcast and the level of service and how they are able to charge whatever amount they want because I have no other option than to argue with Comcast or just give in to their unfair billing practices.
 Sincerely,

Data Cap Limitations,2015-06-23,Paducah,Kentucky,42003,"Data cap limitations are out of hand. I'm already paying several dollars more than most people for just speed, and yet the cap remains the same no matter which of the non-business plans are selected. These fees are unnecessary and just plain senseless. It is stated that this is only a trial, and yet there is no end in sight.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/27/2015 3:17:05 PM:
 Oh, pardon me. I forgot they don't call it a cap, so it's just ""data usage plan"", even though there aren't any options. They say it's not a cap because they can just keep letting it go on and on indefinitely and keep charging you.

Misrepresentation of Internet Speed,2015-04-11,West Chester,Pennsylvania,19382,"I have become fed up with the quality of service I have received from Comcast. They expect people to accept their sub-par internet speeds while they have be given billions of tax payer dollars to improve the speed available to consumers such as I. Please, reconsider the subsidies that are given to Comcast. I mean really, they have the worst customer service record-it's unacceptable that they can get away with.
 For heaven's sake, Comcast is literally the only provider in my apartment. They sold me an internet speed of 125 Mbps! What do i receive right now? An average of 2 Mbps! Are they throttling my internet speed or are there legitimate infrastructure issues? Either way, the amount of money they charge and the amount of tax payer's dollars is unacceptable when we compare to the state of internet availability in other countries. Please rein in Comcast.

Cable Splitter without Consent from customer( Comcast),2015-05-18,Pottsville,Pennsylvania,17901,"When i moved into this renovated townhouse, there was no cable ready service. I paid for Comcast
 to drop the line and have been happy with the service.
 6mo later, second tenant came who also use Comcast. Comcast tecchnician also came for the
 installation. The tenant was rarely home or was home when I am not. He left after a few months.
 In May, new tenant moved in who works from home and has large internet demands. I started to
 have trouble with my internet service. I do not have any internet service at all. Initially I could not
 understand it. I always work from home remotely after leaving the office or when I am on call( i am a
 physician) .
 After 2weeks of investigation that included nightly phone call to Comcast customer service reps,
 recounting the story over and over again to each agent i was transferred to during a call, I was
 informed that my cable is fitted to a splitter before it enters my apartment unit.
 I also spoke to the new tenant upstairs. When they turn off their internet/cell phones, I was able to
 receive internet without trouble. But when they turn on, I get nothing. They also told me that there is
 a splitter per the landlord.
 I query the splitter to my landlord who denies that he is the one who installed the splitter.
 Meanwhile, i found the site where splitter was installed. It was in the basement. It is a 3 way splitter
 which is unpatented. The upstair tenant takes up 2 of the 3 outlet
 I went to Comcast Store/service center in Wyomissing and request thorough investigation of the
 manner. The supervisor reaasure me that a full investigation will be conducted by supervisor
 technician but can not promise when it will happen.
 below is the picture of the unpatented 3 way splitter with no inscription of the frequency capacity.
 thank you for your attention and time.

Comcast quoted one price then billed another,2015-05-04,Pigeon Forge,Tennessee,37863,"On April 9th I ordered a service upgrade to my existing Comcast services. I've saved the chat session
 record showing the monthly price I was quoted and noting that there were no additional monthly fees.
 The order confirmation I received by email, however, shows a monthly fee $10 higher than what I was
 quoted, as well as an additional $3.25 monthly fee that was not disclosed.
 I've called Comcast to resolve this twice. The first time, the issue was escalated to their Customer
 Solutions Dept and I was told to call back during the week and given a confirmation number so that I
 wouldn't have to explain everything again.
 When I called back, they did not recognize the confirmation number I was given, and, after spending
 over 20 minutes on hold waiting for a resolution, I was told that they could not give me the rate that I
 was promised during the chat with the Comcast rep online because we were now on the phone!
 I pointed out that it was illegal to quote one price then charge another -- that this is a crime -- and
 asked for a manager. The rep told me that if she got a supervisor I'd be told the same thing.
 I informed the rep I would be filing a complaint with the FCC.",

Comcast Corporation Data Caps,2015-05-16,Chamblee,Georgia,30341,"Greetings good people of the FCC, my name is and I am filing a complaint in regard to
 Comcast's imposing of data caps on users not only in the Atlanta area, but nationwide. In this widely
 connected digital age, a consistent availability of online service is a cornerstone of American life. That
 aside, it is simply outrageous that paid for residential services in particular have data caps. Many
 people have families, multiple using online devices and services at a time. This quickly consumes
 data, and it is detrimental to consumer relations that such data caps exist, as they clearly do not take
 this into any regard.
 Atlanta is one of the largest metro areas in the country, and it is simply absurd for data caps to exist
 in significant area of the United States. Additionally, it is an exploitative measure I feel, in order to
 undermine alternatives to traditional TV services such as Netflix, and discourage consumers that pay
 for their internet service to pursue such means of entertainment. It is not at all indicative of keeping up
 with the current technologies and services of 2015 and beyond. Everything is connected: game
 consoles, phones, televisions, and even watches. This trend will only magnify in the coming years.
 Data caps are stifling to the current needs and the future potential of such matters.
 With innovative streaming services such as Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon, and many channels
 themselves offering streaming of their own content through online services, there are individuals like
 myself that wish to get their entertainment through the use of such services as opposed to traditional
 TV. Comcast is intentionally trying to stifle such competition I feel through the data caps. Not only do
 I find this unethical, I feel it should be illegal. I do hope the good people at the FCC do take an active
 interest and effort to combat these data caps, as they have no place in a technologically advanced
 society like the United States.
 Please strongly take my words into consideration and thank you for your time.
 Sincerely,",

 RE: COMCAST service at New Bedford MA 02740
 Thank you very much for taking my complaint seriously.
 I have had another problem w. COMCAST. As a Limited Basic subscriber, I am entitled to receive Channel 22 which is FOX 25 Boston. Comcast keeps blocking my access. I have finally called twice, last Sa 6/27/15 and on Monday, 6/29/15 and demanded to speak w. a Manager because 'no one can figure out what is going on...and can't help me. I was connected finally on Monday to John, Management Team Supervisior ID 3650265 in Virginia at 11:10 AM on 6/19/15, who still had no idea why I was being blocked intermittently. He told me to call Comcast and refresh my signal whenever it happened. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!
 Please investigate this issue. When I first subscribed to Comcast in the 1990s, the call center was in Nova Scotia.the reps were wonderful..would help you w/ and internet issue .. Now w. these digital boxes, they are horrible and I refuse to buy new TVs.
 Thank you once again for your assistance w. Comcast.

Comcast horrible service,2015-06-23,Nashville,Tennessee,37207,"Comcast has instituted a cap on my broadband internet service without telling me. When I reach my service cap each month my speeds drastically slow down.
 I've called multiple times about the slow speed. Often times they would ask me to do a speed test and it would instantly speed up only to slow down 30 minutes later back to snail speeds. They also refused to go by the results of a third party speedtest.net site and insisted I used their comcast speed test site. I would run them back to back and consistently the third party test would report speeds 3-8mbs slower than comcast a proprietary speed test site.
 In addition to this, their employees lied to me on the phone stating that they have had the data cap as long as they have provided Internet service. That it is nothing new and that it's actually higher than their competitors. All issues I know are not true. A simple search online will tell you they've tested the cap in parts of Nashville since 2012, not forever. What's worst is they don't disclose this to you in their ads/offers so consumers can't make a fair comparison of what they are getting.
 When I finally called in and reached someone helpful she was able to schedule a technician visit to see if they could find a problem with the line. The technicians called three times and tried to convince me it was a ""national problem"" and that they had fixed it and I should cancel the call. I told them each time I was home and my internet wasn't working still. But they insisted if I gave it more time it would start back on its own. Even when they were at my home testing the service they kept saying it should be working fine and then I show them that no equipment (wifi or hard line connected) could get a signal. They said their equipment showed a signal so it's not them and tried to leave again. I asked them to please physically check everything instead of relying on their network iPad diagnostic and it turns out there was a bad wire connection from their last installer.
 I am a cord cutter. No cable just streaming and local antenna.

 the local office. which I did next day morning. But still it was not able to detect the modem. Then I

Comcast's Unfair Billing and Pricing Practices,2015-06-23,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,15205,"Hi,
 I've been a subscriber to Comcast for quiet some time since Verizon requires a contract for competitive prices. I signed up for a promotional pricing which was only offered to new only new customers (which I don't understand why a service would be cheaper for a year and then $20+ dollars more after that) which expired after a year. I called them to see if I could get a lower price, and after some push back they knocked $10 off of my bill but then charged me $3 to apply this new price. Why would lowering my bill require me to pay them a fee? Comcast also advertises they have the 'fastest in home wifi' but when I first signed up and attempted to rent equipment from them they didn't have any wifi+modem combos available. How can you have the fastest in home wifi if you don't make that equipment available to your customers? Comcast also charges me $56 dollars a month for just internet access yet they have lower pricing available for cable+internet+phone. I don't want cable or a landline phone, a cell phone and neflix subscription already cover those needs for me. Why do I have to pay more money for less service? It doesn't make sense. Thank you for fielding my complaint.

 Last thing! Since Comcast didn't have the equipment necessary to provide the 'fastest in home wifi' as advertised I purchased my own wireless router+modem combo. Unfortunately being a working individual I wasn't able to return my rented modem for almost 3 months. Comcast charged me a rental fee + and additional fee for renting equipment I wasn't actively using. How can this be allowed? (b)

 Why would you ever charge a customer a rental fee PLUS a fee for not using the equipment? If I paid for a subscription service that went unused I would expect after contacting support that they would refund (at least partial, not in full) some of the fees I had paid during the unused time, NOT to be charged more for the unused service.

 Thank you for your help. I just received Comcast's reply to you. Although the issue was eventually cleared up, it was not just a matfer of a new motem. They gave me a new motem which was insufficient (I had to go pick It up and return it). It upped the speed for 1 day and my service dropped (b) (6)
 to dial up speed again. The combination of my having contacted you, and you them, was followed by a phone call from themx a total walk through ( but I had to drive 20 miles to receive the new equipment and 20 miles back). Comcast had a representative who was actually tech savvy work with me for a day and the problem was fixed. So, despite Comcast's response it was just a matter of a new motem, there was a bit more involved. However, at the end, They did offer a credit for the slow speeds were had been receiving.
 I thank you for your help in this matter, and truly believe had the FCC not been involved, The outcome would have been much different.

Comcast bundle billing,2015-05-26,Glendale Heights,Illinois,60139,"Dear FCC,
 Mario S. of Comcast’s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint (see below). While Comcast’s Mario S. accurately restated my current billing situation, his response does not explain or justify Comcast raising my cable and internet 41% one month after I became a Comcast customer. Making my senior community a single provider situation and then exploiting this monopoly is wrong and should be prevented.
 My neighbor (from three doors down the floor) told me that when she was forced into taking the landlord’s bulk cable package (as we all were) for $45.00 a month (as we all pay); Comcast continued to provide her internet for $19.95 a month. When I was forced to take the landlord’s bulk cable package, Comcast started charging me almost as much for internet ($53.95) as they had been charging me for cable and internet ($69.95).
 At a minimum, this consumer would like a justification from Comcast for their 41% exploitation. Sincerely,
 Glendale Heights, IL 60139

 Good afternoon
 I am in receipt of your billing complaint with the FCC. On behalf of Comcast and the Executive Care Office, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience and/or frustration we may have caused while working to resolve your issue. It is never our intention to make the resolution process difficult.
 I thoroughly reviewed your account and confirmed the video portion on your account is included with your association. Additionally I confirmed the account subscribes to performance internet at $53.95. There is also a monthly charge of $10 for the modem rental fee. The modem price increased from $8 to $10 in January 2015 with Comcast’s company rate adjustment. The details of the rate adjustments was included in your December 2014 statement (attached).
 While we continue to make investments in our network and technology to give customers more for their money, including having made 12 speed increases in 14 years, offering the fastest indoor and outdoor XFINITY WiFi connection speeds on our latest advanced Wireless Gateway and offering nearly 8 million total XFINITY WiFi hotspots, we periodically need to adjust prices due to the increases and improvements we make with these new technologies. As always, you can opt to purchase your own router and modem, and we provide a list of devices that we have certified will work with our service at http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/.

 Dear FCC,
 Mario S. of Comcast’s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint by finally revealing that Comcast was charging me for their most expensive residential service and that there were cheaper alternatives that I should be using. I have switched my internet service to the cheaper alternative. Therefore over the sixteen (16) months since I first contacted Comcast about my concerns, Comcast extorted nearly $400 from me.
 As I have previously explained, a month after becoming a Comcast customer Comcast raised my monthly bill 41%. I contacted them immediately and they ignored me. They never responded until I contacted Attorney General Madigan’s office, but even then they did not offer a solution. Comcast did not offer a solution until AG Madigan’s office referred my complaint to the FCC. By dragging this out sixteen (16) months they were able to steal nearly $400. Corporate theft by Comcast is similar to the recent AT&T and Wells Fargo thefts. Corporations find it profitable to steal from their customers, because even when they are caught their penalties are only a small fraction of their theft. With their millions of customers, their thefts would net them billions. Even with an AT&T sized fine, which most people would consider large, that amount would only be a small fraction of their theft. Corporate crime does pay. In our country, we need more Enron/Arthur Anderson type solutions to convince companies that their profits should be earned not stolen.
 Comcast is a criminal enterprise. Sincerely,
 Glendale Heights, IL 60139

comcast xfinity home security service,2015-05-26,Cumming,Georgia,30041,"This complaint is regarding Xfinity Home Security Service. I ordered the service along with Internet
 service, the company called ""Doblue Play"". Today, I found out that there is overcharge for the
 equipment installed for home security. I called Comcast first, after long explaination of my concerns,
 a rep transfered me to Home Security Service Billing Departement. I explained long story again but it
 was helpless. A rep and supervisor told me that I have additional equipments installed. What I
 cannot understand is that I never ordered addtional equipments. The technician should have installed
 the equipments which are included in the package I ordered. But, the rep said any how, addtional
 equipments installed so I have to pay for them. I told her that this is unfair. The reason is that first, I
 didn't order addtional equiments, if there must be addtional charges, the technician should have
 explained to me. When I order the service is the service I wanted. Not mor than that. Now, I have to
 pay for something which I didn't order at all. I don't know why the technician installed too many
 euqipments and didn't explain about the addtional charges. I thought those equipments installed
 were all inclued on the service package I ordered. When I signed on the contract, I wasn't that much
 aware of that there were additioan equipments. I just made sure that if theire were any other charges,
 the tech said no, just need to pay $299 installation fee. That's why I signed on the contract.
 Sencond, Comcast didn't show those charges on the first bill. If Comcast shows those charges on
 the first bill, I would have canceled its servie with 30 day money back guranteed. They show the
 charge on the 2nd bill which generated exactly on the end of the day of 30day money back gurateed.
 So, the supervisor of Xfinity Home Security Service Billing Department said that Sorry, but I have to
 pay for addtional equipments. I told him that please take the equipments back then, He said "" it's all
 yours"" . Nope I don't want it. I didn't even want addtional equioment. ""You guys installed what you
 guys wanted, and now, I have to pay for it?? it's insane."" He said, I can cancel the servise with $880
 penalty.
 If the technician mistakenly installed the addtional equipments, that's also Comcast's fault, so, the
 company has to correct it. Also, showing addtional charges on the billing statement after passing 30
 day moneyback gurantted period seems like deceiving customers.
 I cannot tolerate its lackadaisical attitude toward customers who trust big name of the company.",
Comcast Bandwidth Billing Issue,2015-06-23,Brandon,Mississippi,39047,"Comcast is billing me based on data usage, but I have no visibility into the source of the traffic that is causing my bill to be extremely high.
 For the past several months I've gone over my 300 gigabyte limit by around 300 gigabytes resulting in $50-$60 of additional charges on my bill.
 If they are going to charge for usage, they need to provide customers with tools to manage that usage allowing us to limit bandwidth allocated to a given service, site, or protocol.
 They should also provide us with details on what service, site, or protocol resulted in the bandwidth usage.
 I would switch to another provider, but they have a monopoly in my area.
 There are no comparable internet options in my area.
 Knowing the amount of data I am using is not helpful unless I disconnect my Internet when I am approaching my limit.

Comcast charges,2015-05-06,Windham,New Hampshire,3087,"I have Comcast cable internet for about 5 years. I had my own purchased modem that I started the
 service with and about 1.5 years ago Comcast took my own modem and replaced it with theirs due to
 internet issues. For last 6 months they are charging me rental fees on their modem and are not
 acknowledging that they took my equipment to replace this modem. At the time of modem
 replacement, I was told this will be my unit as they had taken my modem in it's place.",
"Comcast Data Cap in Atlanta, GA",2015-06-05,Cumming,Georgia,30041,"I moved my family of four from Florida, where I had Comcast and an ""unenforced"" 250GB cap where I averaged 300GB/month, to the Atlanta suburbs where Comcast is limiting people to a 300GB cap before charging them $10 per 50GB for overage. The thing is, in the month of May we did nothing different than what we had done in Florida, and yet our usage is 689GB. Why? I can only assume it's because the Comcast service I pay for here is over twice as fast, so I can only assume that the streaming video sites we use regularly (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube) detected the higher bandwidth capabilities and delivered higher quality content, thus using more of our bandwidth. This seems anticompetitive as my whole family must now worry about using competing video services, a fear that benefits Comcast, lest we get charged more and more and more for simply using the service we already pay handsomely for. All it seems I can do is write you and pray Google Fiber eventually makes it here.

"Comcast misrepresented their service area, then charged me for attempting to use it.",2015-06-23,Concord,California,94521,"My wife and I were looking at a house to purchase at . in Concord Ca. It is on the edge of the city area so we made sure to call Comcast and other providers to make sure that we would be covered in the case of having internet service. Both of us work from home so it was quite a primary concern that we have fast and reliable internet, and Comcast was our current provider in the house we were leaving. The fact that they were going to work there was all we needed to hear, but just to make sure, we even called twice.
 A month or so after that, we have the house and we are getting ready to move in. So we call to get the service started only to find out, Comcast does not have service in that area. But it's only 7000 feet away. So they would call us back, and there may be a fee involved, but they can get us hooked up. They did call back, after I made numerous calls to them. They gave me the figure of $180,000 to run the line to our house. I was absolutely floored.
 So we couldn't possibly entertain that number. We have since delayed our move and had to seek out many other alternatives to get the service we required to move in, costing us many thousands of dollars in additional rent among other costs. I have had to take several days off of work to get the microwave wireless service set up. We now have a much lower speed service at roughly 4 times the cost of Comcast that we are forced to use, just to get some basic service. We would never have bought the house if we had known. We are looking to sell the house now very soon and hopefully we won't lose out on that deal as well. We were looking forward to having our own isolated place where we could work from home in peace and it has become an absolute nightmare.
 As if to add insult to this injury, Comcast has since informed me that I will be responsible for a $50 cancellation fee on my previous service because I have moved out of their service area. Despite the fact that I checked with them multiple times to make sure I was in the service area.
 Thank you for your time,

COMCAST,2015-05-21,Miami,Florida,33128,"I have been a loyal customer for more than five years and I have been experiencing a poor internet
 service and an astonishing amount of negligence to solve it.
 My last two bills have been $158 and $190 for 50 mbs internet and basic cable plus latino package,
 YES, But the worst part is, I usually receive less than 10 mps and sometimes a ridiculous reading of 1
 or 2mbs. I work from home and my internet disconnects at least FIVE times a day impacting my
 productivity. I can't watch a netflix movie entirely because I lost signal and I can't work wirelessly
 because the signal is ""schizophrenic"".
 Comcast sent an IT Tech who did nothing but to unplug and plug my modem and tried to engage me
 in ""Personal Business"" asking me to let him ""do the job"" outside of comcast... Totally unacceptable.
 the worst part... I was charged $70 for that atrocity, I was given a partial credit on that. another
 technician visited my place and told me that the service cannot be improved, I consulted my
 neighbors and they told me that their service is very poor... Comcast has been negligent to improve
 the service in my building but have collected based on a bad service. When I called about this
 situation, the representative suggested me that the only thing to do is to change my speed connection
 to 100mbs and bundle my services, he offered it as a courtesy for the horrible services, but I only
 received more mislead.
 I was charged with this ""change in speed"" and my bill went from $130 to $155, and my DVR services
 were suspended, when I called to inquire about it they told me that the DVR would cost extra.
 In sum, I have been paying for an internet service of 50 mbs and I only receive 10 in average and
 sometimes as low as 1mbs, COMCAST is aware of the situation but negligent to solve it. The
 building has a bad connectivity but they prefer to deal with each customer directly before solving the
 root of the problem. They charge money for a service they don’t provide and they are negligent to
 solve it.",
Internet Speeds,2015-06-24,St Johns,Florida,32259,"I have been paying Comcast/XFinity for 50mbps for internet speed since January 2014. 2 weeks ago I did a speed test and determined that my speed was 12 mbps. I called Comcast and was told that the modem they installed (and I pay $10 a month for) cannot handle 50mbps. They were supposed to send me a new one, at a charge to me. This order has been cancelled twice by Comcast, with no notice or explanation. I have spent no less that 12 hours on the phone and have made over 20 phone calls attempting a resolution. When I dial the number, I have to dial 3-4 times, as the first 2-3 times I get a tri-tone stating I can't dial that number from my area. Once I finally get connected, I have to listen to several ""advertisements"" in order to speak to someone. Usually, the call ends at that time for whatever reason. I then have to start over with the 3-4 calls, listen to the advertisements, make the selection about the survey (which they've only called back once). I have toggled back and forth between ""I'll take the survey"" and ""I don't want to take the survey"" because I'm not sure if that is why my call is disconnected. I cannot believe a company is permitted to charge what they do, not provide the service, and put their customers through hell trying to get a resolution.

Comcast Data Caps,2015-06-28,Smyrna,Tennessee,37167,"Within one month of using Comcasts performance internet package in the Nashville metro area, I am being informed that I have exceeded the data cap limits. I find the 300gb limit to be grossly misrepresentative of the common Nashville residents Internet usage. As a growing tech city, Nashville continues to gain tech-heavy professionals who, like myself, are operating in a data rich world for work and personal endeavors. It costs nothing for comcast to increase data caps or remove them entirely. This is purely a profit move by comcast to get more money out of users. I think that if Comcast wants to provide more expensive services then that is their prerogative but to slap on a bunch of outdated fees seems unnecessary. I would like to see this cap removed from my account and for billing to be handled in a professional and honest fashion.

internet and on demand service,2015-04-22,Detroit,Michigan,48207,"First thank you for addressing my complaint so promptly. Unfortunately Comcast has not resolved my issue and I feel they are giving me the run around. When you forwarded my complaint to Comcast they called me Monday April 21, 2015 and set up an appointment for Tuesday April 22, 2015 between the hours of 5and 7 pm making a special note not to come before 6 pm so I could arrive home from work. When a Comcast technician had not arrived by 7:15 pm I called. First the Comcast Rep said that I did not have an appointment, when I explained that a Comcast rep had personally called me and set it up the rep said I cancelled it. I am so frustrated with this nonsense Comcast is a multi billion dollar company and they can't straighten out my internet and on demand service. Comcast customer service sucks! It is bad enough that I sometimes have to struggle to understand what most of their customer service reps are saying. Is there anyway you can light a fire under them? All I want is to receive the services I am paying for. In this age of technology the internet is a necessity for me and my family and we are all very inconvenienced.

Comcast Billing,2015-04-14,Gallatin,Tennessee,37066,"I have previously written to the FCC regarding overbilling of my comcast account for an 18 month period. After filing my last complaint, I was contacted by Comcast through text message and they told me they had credited my account and I had a negative balance of $19.59. I had requested several times to establish a consistent amount for my services. They did not respond. I came home last night to find that my services were again shut off. When I called their customer service number, after being transferred 3 times and left on hold for 28 minutes, I was informed that I have a balance due of $801.00. I do not know where to turn. This situation has caused me severe emotional upset and distress. They told me I was being charged with a $500.00 early termination fee plus an additional $300.00 that they could not explain. I did not terminate my agreement. I took a stand after 18 months of overpayment and being lied to by their representatives over 40 times. I finally stopped paying until they would rectify my issues. I thought they had done so on January 31st. It seems they can never be taken at their word.. I have all the text messages from them that prove what I am saying to you. Please advise me as to what I can do to resolve this impossible situation. There is no other internet provider in my neighborhood at this time. You may also reach me by phone at .

comcast,2015-06-24,Pueblo,Colorado,81004,"Comcast is aware that they are the only high speed provider in our town which makes their ""support"" quite cavalier when dealing with customers, at least in our experience.
 Further, we only require Internet service but due to their pricing, we were forced to buy the cable tv service for a lower overall price than what just the Internet would cost. We do not want the TV service and I can, literally, count on one hand the time we've even turned the tv on. And a couple of those times were at the directive of their ""support"" (and I am using that term loosely) when we had Internet service issues.
 The only way to get information online as to what current pricing is, is by giving your address and once you do, you are not able to get their current pricing information due to your computer/user being recognized. You are forced to log in to your account and then they modify what is shown to you as available. Even when I attempt access via my account, their system tells me my phone number/ ss number doesn't match. Since I've had the same SS number since I was 14 and the same phone number for at least 6 years, I'm pretty sure it's being entered correctly. It feels like they are purposely hiding current pricing information and the only way to get it is to spoof your location/address/etc. using incognito and a vpn.
 Finally, we have been paying a 4.99 a month charge for what they call their ""service protection plan"" yet the last three times we have had issues with our service, they have claimed it was our modem (which it turned out it never was) and that we would have to pay them to send someone for service. Their ""troubleshooting"" consists of having you turn things on and off for at least 30 minutes then the say it's your modem.
 Comcast seems to have a system in place that wears you down until you go away and it's despicable the way their ""support"" is handled - how could our past issues always have been our modem when it turned out it was never the modem? A rhetorical question but nonetheless, a good one.

Jason Harris the comcast tech who I spoke with directly and who promised to be here on the 15th of April between 1-5 has yet to return my call and Comcast just keeps sending a request that someone service our business. But no one can give me a date and time of when this can be done! This is unacceptable! We have an online marketing team who will be here tomorrow 4/17/2015 and needs internet to do their job.

"Comcast-Non existent customer service, terrible internet connection",2015-06-11,Vincentown,New Jersey,8088,"I have had nothing but problems with Comcast in the 3 months that I have had their ""service"" - or lack thereof. They missed 2 appointments when I scheduled to have my internet installed and was told that not only would I not be charged once they finally had a technician come out, but I would get a credit for the missed appointments. They charged me $50 for the technician appointment and when I called to complain about the extra charge, the customer service line was absolutely terrible. I could not get in touch with anyone who spoke English and all they could give me were rehearsed, staged responses. I was finally able to speak to two representatives in two different departments who ensured that the charges were removed. However, I logged back into my account the next day and the charges were still there. I had to call back again and ask to speak to a supervisor, who told me that there was no note or anything on my account to remove the charges. The supervisor was able to finally remove them for me. However, I still have complaints because the service is basically non-existent. I am a college student enrolled in online classes and I lose internet connection at least five times a day. I don't know why I am even paying for the service if I am not able to use it.

Unfair Billing Practices,2015-06-25,Springfield,Illinois,62701,"There are currently 2 realistic ISP's in Springfield, IL which are Comcast and AT&T. I am currently a customer of Comcast which refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television and request only internet. In fact, the price increases by nearly $15 dollars a month for the reduced service of solely internet. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package is ""$55 dollars a month"" however, Comcast adds a an additional $10 modem fee each month and with taxes the total is $70 monthly. However, 2 years ago the total bill for the exact same services was $50 monthly after taxes and fees.
 Due to the increased price of solely internet, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 2 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, decreased services would lead to a decreased price. However, in Comcast's world, you are forced to take on services that you never use or face a significantly increased monthly rate.
 Similarly, I have called AT&T and they refuse to offer solely internet as well. As is the case with Comcast, getting only internet actually increases your monthly bill.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 This may seem like a petty expense, but I am trying to buy my first car. Without cutting other unnecessary expenses like cable I very well may not be able to do so. In effect, Comcast is limiting my ability to contribute to other sectors of the economy through overcharging for services that I do not need.
 Thank you very much for your consideration.

Poor service,2015-04-20,Falmouth,Massachusetts,2536,Service is not reliable,
Comcast in Indianapolis scam,2015-05-08,Indianapolis,Indiana,46217,"Hello. I have been a customer with comcast for several years. I am currently paying over 150 a month
 for internet, cable, and xfinity home protection. I priced out all of these with other companies, and I
 can get all 3 services for around 80-90 a month from different carriers. My contract expired over a
 year ago, as was confirmed by several of their employees when I spoke on the phone. I called
 several times to try to cancel my service with comcast, but supposedly I am still under contract with
 comcast, even though the only document that I have ever signed with comcast, which I have right
 here in my hand, was for a 2 year agreement and was signed in 2012.
 I can not pay that much for services, as I just had a new addition to my family (a baby girl), and I am
 tired of being lied to by their representatives. My wife and I have talked to no less than 17 employees
 at comcast in the last month or so (a total of 3 different calls), all of which had told us something
 different, ranging from , we are so sorry, to your monthly bill has been lowered to 90 a month with free
 channels, to now it has switched to 120, to we can't help you, suck it up, to supervisors refusing to
 speak to me (2 have refused), to telling me that there is a 600 dollar termination fee, etc.
 I have called, personally, on two occasions about this issue, and between the 2 calls, I was on the
 phone between 3-4 hours and was transferred to no less than 9 people, all of them telling me
 something different, and some straight up lying to me by telling me that they are going to do
 something or lower something, and then it never happens. A few have even hung up on me and I had
 to call back. My wife has called about this issue on one occasion, and spoke to no less than 6 people,
 being lied to as well.
 I cannot afford 150 a month for services, and tried to be nice and kind when I called. You think for a
 customer who was willing to try to work things out with comcast that we could be treated better. This
 is my last chance to resolve this. This is for internet, cable, and home security through comcast.
 Thanks.

Uncompetitive pricing of Comcast Internet services,2015-06-23,Salt Lake City,Utah,84102,"Comcast is charging me $77.64 a month for XFINITY Internet service. The approximate speeds I currently get are commonly less than 40mbps down and 7mbps up. Google Fiber provides internet speeds of 1000mbps up and 1000mbps down for approximately $70 a month. If I were to pay Google for the bandwidth I am receiving from Comcast, I would be paying about $3. I am receiving speeds 20x slower for the same cost. Very uncompetitive.
 Additionally, no other Comcast service exists for less money for similar bandwidth. If you try to reduce your bill, they will offer you faster internet, but only if you ""bundle"" with their TV services. I don't watch TV. TV doesn't matter to me.
 Also, my Internet price has increased from a promotional ~$30 to ~$76 a month for the same speeds and equipment. Even at $30, the cost is overpriced by over 10x Google Fiber's cost.

Comcast: Xfinity Slamming,2015-06-29,Atlanta,Georgia,30315,"After several days last week of intermittent internet through my Comcast Xfinity account in Atlanta, Georgia, I called customer service to complain for the 2nd time. The person I spoke with at Comcast claims to have fixed my internet through backend systems.
 The Comcast representative proceeded to tell me that I could have 25Mbps more for the same price (75Mbps total) however, it would require a new modem. He processed the order and I hung up. I did receive a UPS tracking number via e-mail the next day to track my package.
 The package arrived today and after I opened it, I discovered that it was a Digital to Analog video set top box and that I had been signed up for new TV service through Xfinity.
 At no time did I ever bring up TV service nor did I authorize this Comcast representative to sign me up for TV. This is a clear cut case of slamming/cramming.
 I just hung up with Comcast customer service and was told that the 75Mbps plan existed and did NOT require a new modem and it was $1 more per month than my old plan.

Comcast,2015-06-23,Windsor,Colorado,80550,"Extremely poor customer service. Customers are directed to Forums which are really complaint pages, literally hundreds of them, for answers to problems with connectivity. Many of the answers come from consumers, not IT professionals. It is incredibly hard to get answers over the phone if you have an issue, often you are routed and re-routed to several different people, none of whom are able to give answers or tell you there is no problem. I really wish someone from the FCC would just go to the help and support pages of Comcast and LOOK at what people are saying. This company is one of the largest around and people are being treated with disrespect or ignored completely. Someone needs to hold them accountable to the public that pays their wages.

Comcast had said I had a credit but then issued a regular bill,2015-06-02,Tracy,California,95376,"I turned in Comcast equipment (modem and router with wires) and was told in person that I would get a credit automatically on my bill and I didn't have to do anything. I was told by phone they could see a credit but then when it came time for them to bill for my next billing cycle they issued me a regular bill with no credits and no mention on the bill of turning in any of their equipment. I kept the receipt to prove I did turn in their equipment. I bought my own modem to keep from having to pay them the $10 a month fee. Then they have the nerve to keep billing me as usual. The modem fee should be gone since I turned it in. I guess they expect me to go down to their office and make a separate trip to get my credit but like I was told I should not have to do that. The rep logged in both items that I turned in and showed me in her computer that it was there.

Comcast Overcharge for Internet Service for over One Year,2015-06-22,Hatfield,Pennsylvania,19440,"Recently discovered that for at least one year I've been charged an additional $75.95 per month for internet, despite already paying for Blast Internet as part of my $199.99 HD Complete Package. That's an overbill of $911. And it probably was going on for longer than a year but only 12 months of bills are on line for me to look at. Began calling on 5/12/15 and followed up with at least 5 additional calls. Each rep acknowledges the overcharge and tells me that it has been ""escalated"" to a higher power. Usually put on hold then to speak with a supervisor and then ultimately they cut me off. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I owe them a past due balance at this point, but I don't think I should have to pay them if they owe ME a credit. Have paid the ""corrected"" monthly charges in order to keep my TV-Phone-Internet works. What brought it to my attention was a letter they sent saying that I was a ""Performance"" customer but was receiving ""Blast"" speed. Have repeatedly been told that someone will contact me to rectify. Shame on me for not realizing the overbill months ago, but for their ""customer service"" reps to acknowledge the error and NOT be able to get the credit is maddening. Thanks for any help or assistance you can provide.

Comcast unfair pricing,2015-06-24,York,Pennsylvania,17403,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.

Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 I failed to mention one other issue I have had with Comcast and their billing. When my wife and I moved to our residence 3 years ago, we moved our Comcast internet service from the home we were previously renting to the home we had just purchased. Comcast will provide you with a modem for their internet service and charge you $7/month to ""rent it."" To bypass this fee I chose to purchase my own modem, and we were using it at our previous residence. I informed the tech installing my service that I had my own modem. I didn't check my bill to see if I was being charged for a modem I wasn't using until over a year later. I realized my bill seemed a lot higher than what I was originally quoted and realized they had been billing me the $7 fee for a modem rental when I was using my own
 device. Billing history proved they had been billing me for over 18 months for a modem I didn't have. I called to complain and was immediately refunded $21 (or 3 months worth of fees). I was told that a member of management had to approve the refund of the other 13 months ($91) of fees and that I would hear from a Comcast representative within 10 business days. That time came and went. After calling back into Comcast I was told by a different rep that that the 3 months was all they would refund and it was my responsibility to ensure my bill was correct.
 How is this an acceptable business practice? I made sure to inform the only Comcast representative I encountered when my service was connected to my home that I had my own device. He did not install one of the Comcast devices when he was on site. I am sure that paperwork had to be filed in some way to prove he was at my home. A call had to be made to turn on the service and ensure my modem could be seen on their network. If you speak to Comcast today any tech will tell you that it states ""Customer has own modem"" all over our account as we have complained to them several times about this issue. How hard is it to refund $91 to a customer that YOU mistakenly billed and it was not the fault of the customer?
 Again, I would use a different vendor for my services, but there are no other options for me.

Data Overages,2015-04-01,Savannah,Georgia,31406,"I am a Comcast customer and as a family of two, have to constantly juggle our 300GB data allotment. I recently purchased a PS4 game console, and single game downloads can reach 50GB in size, and mandatory updates for already owned games commonly reach 5-10 GB size. My wife likes to watch shows on Netflix, and these can run 2GB/hour of streaming.
 We are constantly having to check our usage to make sure we are not running over our allotted 300GB limit. Our monthly service charge is $30/month for internet usage, making a 10 GB/dollar ratio. Their overage charge is $10 for 50GB of data, making a 5GB/dollar ratio, which just seems like they are taking advantage of customers who use more data than alloted.
 If data allowances cannot be overcome, there must be a more sensible solution than this. This is causing my family stress as we shouldn't have to worry about how much data we are using as two full time workers who only get to use Internet capable devices for only a few hours a day.

Comcast in violation of merger terms,2015-06-27,League City,Texas,77539,"Comcast is my only available choice of broadband cable internet in my area and does not offer a standalone internet option that is less than if it were bundled with cable TV service. I believe that this violates the merger conditions set by the Commission when Comcast merged with NBCU and also artificially inflates cable TV subscription numbers.
 This came up when Comcast began increasing my cable internet price by $10 a month, two months in a row, taking my bill from $58/month to $83/month after fees. This is the same price as Comcast's Double Play bundle for cable and a higher speed internet connection. I should not have to pay the same price for internet as another customer who has two services. When I contacted Comcast they would only offer me a lower price if I would add cable TV service. The agent explicitly told me I would not get a lower price if I did not accept one of their bundles. The agent instead decreased my connection speed, seriously reducing my quality of services utilizing an internet connection which includes calling via wi-fi on my cell phone. This is a necessity to me as I do not get a cell signal on my property nor do I have a land line. The agent informed me that the amount would be credited towards the bill I was complaining about but instead put it on my next billing cycle, causing me a problem with a carry over amount that was late and triggering a late charge. These are unacceptable practices. I should be offered a reasonable rate for an internet-only service, one that falls in line with the price of adding internet to a cable-only service.
 Nor does Comcast offer reasonable bundle pricing; basic cable with 140 channels costs $65.99/month, high-speed internet at 105 Mbps costs $78.95/month, the two together: $84.99/month, surprisingly the same cost as the bundle with only 50 channels! This seems to be designed to force users into a cable TV subscription and is in blatant disregard of the Commission's terms on the Comcast-NBCU merger. Comcast should not be able to pay to ignore the terms imposed on them and I implore the commission to address the issue of Comcast's unreasonable fee scheme.
 If cable TV prices are $49.99 for the 140 channels offered to me as a bundle for less than I was paying for internet alone, then my internet only subscription should be a similar price. That would make bundling the two together net the user a $15 discount, a very reasonable amount. As it is, the bundle offered to me that forces me to have a cable TV subscription nets the user at $50 discount, or the cost of the cable TV subscription. The only conclusion I can draw is that Comcast is giving away cable TV to inflate their subscription numbers.

Comcast knowingly over billed,2015-06-03,Fort Myers,Florida,33908,"Comcast knowingly over billed me again. I recently sent a complaint and not only had conversations with them, but proved to them in writing their billing me for a service call was incorrect. Their latest bill did not remove the charges and they refuse to remove them. Additionally, they added a late fee (which could have an effect on my credit). This has been a continuous struggle with Comcast. I am asking the FCC not only to get involved and stop just sending this to Comcast to resolve... because they don't... but to fine Comcast for continuously putting customers through this horrendous activity, wasting peoples time and costing them money to resolve issues. Now they say I am being charged a late fee for their mistake. My Gosh... When will someone from the FCC actually help!!! Comcast is horrible and you know it... but you do nothing!!!

Price increase while on a fixed price plan,2015-04-03,Pearland,Texas,77585,"In 2014 my 2 year contract with Comcast expired, so via the telephone Comcast offered a 3 year plan for $120/month for internet, cable an telephone. I never received that contract per email. Pretty soon I had to call again, as Comcast was charging more than the agreed price. After going escalating to the office of the CEO the price went back to $120 per month.
 In November 2014 Comcast indicated that I needed a new cable modem, and they indicated that having the new modem would not influence the price. After installing the new modem, the price went up to $124.61 per month. When I asked Comcast why the increased the price, the agent indicated that it had to do with the improvements in the technology...the new modem oa.
 I tried to undo the price increase...no chance. Alas, in my area there is no second provider who can offer a similar package. So I am stuck with Comcast. In that case, I want them to honour their commitment of 3 years $120/month.

"Incorrect charges, and would not fix",2015-06-23,Bloomington,Illinois,61701,"A little over two weeks ago I moved to a new apartment. I went to purchase internet through Comcast since it is one of the only providers in my area for fast internet. I saw online a promotional price available in my area when I typed in my address until the beginning of the week of 6/21/15, for $39.99/mo for Blast! Internet at 50mbps for the first year. The second year was $54.99/mo, then after that would be the regular price of $76.95.. I purchased it online, set up my account, and my internet worked. I was surprised at how there was no hassle aside from conveniently not receiving an order confirmation email even though my order went through.
 On 6/18 or 6/19 I received my Comcast bill and I was being charged $76.95/mo for the internet service, and not the $39.99/mo that was shown on the website and the Order Information page before I actually submitted my order. I called Comcast support on the phone and each person I told about my issue said a variation of ""I can't do that, let me transfer you to this department who should be able to help you."" I was transferred through 5 people, before the 5th person went to transfer me to somebody else. While waiting for the 6th person to pick up, the line was disconnected. I called back and had to go through the whole automated thing again so I could talk to a person, and when being transferred to a person, the line disconnected me not once, but twice. I eventually reached another person who told me ""Oh, if its an online promotion we are unable to do anything about it over the phone. You need to use the online chat for this issue.""
 I then went to use the online chat and talked to one person who said ""That promotion does not exist and is not available in your area. The only offer available in your area is $59.99/mo for Internet Plus + Blast!"" So i asked him how this deal cannot exist if I am specifically looking at the deal right now that says its available for my area. He would not answer. Eventually our chat ended. Within moments of our chat ending, my person modem (not rented through Comcast) was restarted and I did not have internet for about 5-10 minutes. Convenient that it happened right after he had access to my account.
 I talked to a second chat person and she was extremely helpful and completely understood why I was unhappy. She noticed my account was improperly marked as a current customer rather than a new customer and that is why I was not given the promotional price. She notated my account that my package should be the Blast! $39.99/mo, but I had to call Customer Solutions Team and they would see the notation and fix my service in the system. I called them and ended up with a person from Billing I think who transferred me to somebody else who could help me. Even though my account was notated to be fixed, she would not fix it and said that the deal was not in her system for her to change it either. I again talked to somebody else who ALSO said that deal did not exist and that if it is an online promotion then they do not have access to it and the only way to get that promotion is to be a new customer and purchase online. This lady had an offer for $49.99/mo Blast! Internet, and offered me a $120 credit which would basically make it a $39.99/mo Blast! Internet. I still wasn't too happy
 but I wasn't sure if any other person would offer me this. I was still was concerned with my bill because I was being charged the full price for this month still, and she said I would just be given the credit on next months bill. But that doesn't solve the issue that I'll be paying 1 month at $76.95, and 11 months at $49.99 with a $120 credit. If I had the full 12 months at $39.99 I would end up paying $480, but with this $76.95 for 1 month + 11 months of $49.99 - $120 credit I'll be paying $506. She didn't seem to understand that. In addition to that, it would be $49.99/mo for the first year, then $69.99/mo for the second year, then the regular price of $76.95/mo afterwards meaning that the credit would only benefit me for the first year but I was still being screwed over on the second year by $180. I talked to another person and tried explaining it to her and she understand what I was concerned with but she also said she could not offer me the $39.99/mo promotion because it was not in the system even though that is what I confirmed my order on.
 So at this point, I was stuck with the $49.99/mo + $120 credit, but was screwed over for the second year. I looked at my account today (6/23/15) and I received credits of $8, $53.36, and $21.56, but at the same time I also received additional charges of $53.56 and $8. meaning I still had a credit of $21.56 on my account. However, it still says I owe Comcast the full price of the Internet. As a new customer I am completely disgusted with how they treated me.

comcast over charges,2015-06-24,Manchester,New Jersey,8759,"Comcast has continued to raise our bill over the last 4 months by $50.00 + without approval or notification for additional services. Comcast has been called on the issues over 10x. I even started recording the phone interactions since I would get passed from department to department and was made to repeat my situation each time, speaking to ""supervisors"" that have no weigh in making any account changes. My boyfriend and I are 25 years old, work full time and struggle each month to fix comcast's continuos errors. Like many others that likely reach no progress with this company, we get stuck paying their outrageous bill. Ours is currently $174.00/month and seemingly getting higher and higher every bill cycle. Our original bill, back in the beginning of the year, floated around $119.00/month. We feel scammed by Comcast.

Payment disappear - service got disconnected,2015-04-08,Acworth,Georgia,30102,"Back in January 2015 I made 2 payments: One for January's service and one for February's service (advance payment). In March I go to the web page to make my payment and I see that my account shows past due. I call Comcast to find out where my payment went since it was deducted from my bank account. I offered them to send a copy of my bank statement. They did not seem to care about that. They give me a confirmation number for the investigation and they promise to call me back. Not only they did not call me back but they turned off my service. I called again and they gave me another confirmation number of the same investigation. They promised to restore my service while the investigation is completed. My service is still off. I had to call me bank and start another investigation. Comcast does not seem to care at all. Are they committing FRAUD with their customer's money?

Comcast Unfair Billing Practices,2015-04-18,Dania Beach,Florida,33004,"When I started new service, I opted to have a self-install kit which was suppose to be free. I was unable to install the kit because the previous tenant had disconnected a cable within the walls. Obviously, this is not an issue I could have fixed or foreseen. I called Comcast and they said that a installer would come FREE of charge to help with the issue. Once the installer came, he asked if I accepted the installation fee. I said no, because Comcast said it would be free. He said, he only gets paid when I accept the charge. I said that he can say whatever he wants, but that I would dispute the issue with Comcast. He was making me feel guilty for not wanting to accept the charge. I called Comcast and they said that they never agreed that the installation fee would be waived and they went ahead and charged me the $40. They said I could debate this charge with my landlord. I find these practices to be deceitful and I feel cheated by this company. I was forced to pay this amount, which they claimed would be waived.
 The fact that the previous tenant disconnected a cable within the walls was not my fault, nor was it theres. But I don't believe that as a customer, I should have to assume that financial responsibility. Especially because they're a huge corporation and I am a full-time student.

 Both my husband and I work from home and telecommute with different companies. we pay for
 increased internet speed which I do not believe we have. I was told our cable line needed
 replacement, they would need a permit from the city and would call us ahead of time so we could go
 into our business offices to work without interrupted services. they did not call, my husband had to go
 to Caribou to do a conference call, I lost service. I called Comcast when the employees cut through
 my Invisible Fence line. Was told they were not to be there until May 31, they did not have the permit
 yet. was told a supervisor would call me and a field supervisor would come out...neither happened.
 was told I would receive a call after I called back again, no response. we are continually lied to.

 Hi,
 The Comcast rep still wants to justify their billing and wants me to pay the excessive bill for just internet service. If you do not take an action then it is too bad. They have no justification for the more bill except they own the service in the area and they have no sympathy if you cannot afford.

 Hi

 Sent from my iPhone"
Poor service from Comcast Xfinity,2015-05-01,Milford,Delaware,19963,"We pay for ""up to 100Mbps"" of download speeds per month. The speeds we receive are wildly
 inconsistent and barely usable.",
Internet service disconnected accidentally by Comcast personnel. Poor service.,2015-04-03,Savannah,Georgia,31405,"Comcast called me and left a message to inform me they needed to disconnect service at my address in order to provision a new customer. I called back and was told to ignore that call, that it was a misdirected call and my service would NOT be disconnected. Later that day, April 2nd, my service was in fact disconnected.
 The address is a multi-family dwelling with 40 lots. Obviously they disco'd the wrong address.
 7 calls later (and 5 disconnected calls with no call-back) I finally got the service restored - after 2 hours of phone time with Comcast personnel.
 Each call required me to repeat my story to each agent, then to each supervisor after a required escalation.
 The whole provisioning process seems broken. I'm really frustrated with the inept customer service and the multiple hand-offs, having to repeat the background each time I was disconnected,
 I am very disappointed that an existing customer's service can be disconnected without verifying directly with the customer. This was simply sloppy work, followed by very poor customer service.
 This mistake cost the Comcast company a lot of time in multiple call centers. and cost me, the customer, 2 hours of my personal time, 7 phone calls, and an unacceptable amount of ""rework"" in repeating the problem over and over to each new representative.
 Being a process engineer, I experienced inconsistent process, inconsistent solutions to the problem, depending on which agent I spoke with, and broken process (leaks) that allowed a customer to be accidentally disconnected. A costly mistake that required a lot of rework, frustration, and a very poor customer experience.
 One of my worst experiences in over 25 years of IT and customer service experience.

Xfiniti account,2015-06-08,Steamboat Springs,Colorado,80477,"When logged into comcast xfinity's online account, my bill reads $0.00, as I have attempted to setup auto pay...this should be normal. Today I received an email threatening to disconnect service if $200 plus was not paid. I have been on hold for over an hour and cannot do anything while logged into there system. I will not pay a bill without an itemized invoice of charges and feel as though I am being penalized. I also requested that the extra ""xfinitywifi"" signal coming from my equipment to be turned off months ago and now see it is still there. So in essence, xfinity is showing that I owe nothing on my account, but threatening to disconnect if I don't pay $200+ without an itemized bill all the while stealing my electricity for there service after I requested it turned off.

Inability to call 911 service during a power outage,2015-05-04,Lakewood,Colorado,80227,"In late April or early May of 2015, there was a power outage at my house in Lakewood, Colorado.
 During the outage, I prepared to make a phone call since my phone service with Comcast has always
 worked previously during power outages.
 This time there was no phone service. After the power came back on, I called Comcast and learned
 that while my old modem from Comcast had backup batteries, the new Comcast modem I had
 acquired several months earlier did not. I was not informed of this fact when I exchanged modems at
 the local Comcast store. During the recent phone call to Comcast they did inform me I could buy a
 backup battery for $35 plus shipping.
 This causes me concern since I am not be able to access 911 service which would tell the 911
 operator my name.and location. I feel strongly that 911 service, even during a power outage, should
 be a basic requirement for phone providers, not a customer option via a supplementary battery.",
Internet Availability and Speed,2015-06-24,Alexandria,Indiana,46001,"Hi there,
 I would like to submit a formal complaint about my internet service through Comcast Cable. During the day, typically during noon or mid-day my internet connection will slow down or completely drop all together.
 The connection drop will last anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes and happen repeatedly throughout the day. I would like this to be taken care of and fixed ASAP as this has gone on for a while and we have good Internet equipment.

 Ny service Comcast, xfinity, is terrible. I have called them numerous times, to no avail. I get regular error messages, my cable goes out completely, the remote functionality fails when watching movies, the picture is pixelated too often, I access movies and tent will not play, displaying error messages, for channels I am paying for. I filed a separate complaint due to the lack of promised internet bandwidth speed, but this is something that as a consumer, locality tax-payer, disabled veteran, and an active account holder with Comcast, is not acceptable. I also can't fathom why my rate goes up without any explanation. I received a letter indicating they are going to charge me for a receiver they were unaware of....they installed everything in our house, and, nothing is new or purchased after market. They have done this three times since we switched to xfinity last year.

Comcast Xfinity,2015-04-21,Concord,New Hampshire,3301,"I have subscribed to a Comcast Xfinity internet service plan with advertised speeds of 25Mbps since December 2014 and am based in Concord, NH. I work from home and require frequent, fast access to a variety of data services. Although 25Mbps should be sufficient for my usage needs, I have found through Comcast's own testing software that I do not even get half of this advertised speed. Their own tools show I receive from 7-9Mbps speeds during non-peak usage hours. This is apparently not due to any type of connection limitation, as their technician verified the signal strength of the connection during their December installation visit.
 Prior to December, I was working in Tokyo, Japan where I had a residential fiber optic internet connection with 200Mbps connectivity for the equivalent of $40/mo. This makes Comcast's deficiencies all the more glaring and unforgivable. My return to the US has been a bitter experience, to say the least, in regard to the subpar communications infrastructure. It is even more insulting that I am paying more for less here. That, in itself, might be more tolerable if I even received the speeds I am paying for.
 It's alarming that Comcast wants to merge with TWC, considering their status as one of America's most disliked companies in terms of consumer satisfaction. Even if the merger does not happen, however, the reality for me remains that as a resident of Concord, I have no other choice apart from Comcast. Punctuating Comcast's disregard for service quality is the fact that they advertise a certain level of internet service and then severely under-deliver.
 At this point, I have no other choice except to approach the FCC with my complaint, with the hope of seeing some type of improvement from Comcast. At the very least, I think I deserve to actually get the services I am paying for.

 I am in receipt of a copy of the letter send to the FCC by Vanessa Fisher of Comcast on May 13, 2015. In her letter, Ms. Fisher states that ""I attempted to contact several times to discuss his concerns. Unfortunately, my attempts were unsuccessful."" Ms. Fisher goes on to state that in order to resolve the issue, it is necessary to speak with me directly.
 Ms. Fisher did indeed reach out to my home phone during business hours, leaving a voice mail with her contact information. Likewise, she also emailed me on May 11, 2015 with a summary of the matter and her request to speak with me. As I had been traveling at the time, upon return I attempted to reply to both Ms. Fisher's voice mail and email on May 19 and May 20, respectively.
 Neither of my initial replies received a response from Ms. Fisher. I once again attempted to email her on May 22, which again received no response. I once again reached out to Ms. Fisher on May 29 (this morning) to alert her that I have not received any response to any of my messages and that I am still suffering with connectivity issues. On the afternoon of May 29, I received the copy of Comcast's letter to the FCC and subsequently reached out again to Ms. Fisher by both voice mail and email to let her know that I will be making every effort, on each business day going forward to connect with her on this issue, to find a satisfactory resolution.
 This issue is not resolved and Comcast has yet to make any substantial effort toward its resolution.

Comcast's Terrible Service - How are they still in business?,2015-05-28,Atlanta,Georgia,30309,"Today, 5/28/15, is the 6th time we've called Comcast regarding install of internet in my new home.
 What is worst of all is that I originally called on 5/12/15 to ensure proper connection and avoid
 disruption in my service. I was told it would be an easy switch that we'd be able to self install and
 there wouldn't be any problems. Definitely not the case. Internet didn't work as soon as we got to our
 house. It's been 7 days since I moved in and I still don't have internet, but more than that - I have not
 heard truth from ANY of the company's representatives - even supervisors. When you call them, it
 says, ""We make it easy for you to move to your new home. With convenient date selections to have a
 professional come to your home on the same day."" Such lies.
 The first time we called, we were told it is that our modem is no longer supported so we had to go out
 to buy a new modem, only to find that our internet STILL did NOT work.
 Since then, we've had 3 appointments set up for a dispatcher to come to our home; 1 of the
 appointments/calls, they apparently have no record of and 2 were no-shows. Thus far, we've spoken
 to 2 supervisors; one of which even gave us his personal phone # to ensure ""we are taken care of
 and treated properly"" and that a tech would show up. Still no show.
 Was about to post a bad review/note on Facebook to see if it would catch their attention, only to find
 negative posts on the ENTIRE page regarding Comcast's Customer Service. How is this okay? How
 can a company see no value in providing even the most basic level of customer service to their
 paying customers? In a world where endless options are available, it seems Comcast can only get
 away with this because there is almost a monopoly in the cable/internet industry with only 2 providers
 available.
 FCC - Comcast needs to be reprimanded and held to a higher standard of customer service. They
 cannot continue to get away with this.
 I just canceled my service.",
Fees not disclosed before service was installed,2015-05-17,Brookhaven,Georgia,30319,"I called Comcast to have internet installed. I was informed the only charge was 44.99 a month. My bill
 showed an additional $61.45 of services I was not made aware of or agreed to. They charged me
 $39.95 for a technician visit and $20 for an install. Not of which were agreed to. Had I known of these
 charges I would have not had them install it. I called them and asked them to adjust the bill and they
 refused saying they are valid.",

comcast service,2015-06-25,Brookhaven,Pennsylvania,19015,"Their prices change constantly and their customer service is horrible. I have been trying to call them to report wires that were knocked loose from a telephone pole. My service is currently working. I want someone to fix the wires. All anyone can tell me is service will be restored soon. I HAVE service! I want the wires fixed that are now hanging very low in my yard! No one seems to understand that.

Comcast Poor Customer Service and Degraded Service,2015-06-30,Laurel,Maryland,20708,"I have less than advertised connection speed for over 45 days. I have contacted Comcast over 12 times during this time period. Each time the Comcast rep would spend 15 minutes or more with me and then forwarded me to another person who was supposed to fix it, but was neither briefed about the problem or could fix it. Service outages or degradation in my area were the common excuses. A tech was sent to my home and changed the router, but still no relief. I called customer service again on 18 Jun 2015 and they said they would make up for the inconvenience by providing upgraded service at a reduced price, but when the second tech was sent to my home on Father's Day he was not advised to bring the cable box and router needed for the upgrade. Since then, I have called several times, pawned off to multiple levels, promised returned phone calls, and no one has called or corrected the issue. Bottom Line: Comcast has not lived up to their service guarantee or provided the service we have paid for.

Terrible Comcast experience - No end in sight,2015-05-05,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,19123,"I am currently a Comcast customer. My roommates just recently moved to a new house a few blocks
 away. We called the week of April 27th (prior to our move on May 2nd) to find out what we need to do
 to move cable/internet into our new house. We reviewed our service plan with your representative.
 After a lengthy conversation, and going through our plan line by line, he distinctly told us that our bill
 will be $134+tax per month. This was to include all of our current services, and told us that we could
 bring our current equipment over to the new house and plug it in. We agreed to everything, and
 thought everything was taken care of.
 On May 3rd, we went to our local Comcast center (Columbus Blvd, Philadelphia, PA), to pick up a
 new box, exchange a box, and drop off our modem (we purchased our own). When we talked to the
 representative there, she said there were numerous problems with our account:
 1. Our new address was not indicated ANYWHERE on our account. There was nothing on our
 account stating that our service was switching locations.
 2. She explicitly stated that the ""$134+ per month was a lie"". Our bill would be at least $178+tax per
 month. Also, the internet package we were told that we were getting ""didn't exist"".
 3. This representative told us that we needed to downgrade all of our boxes to basic cable. She was
 audibly cursing about the first representative, and visibly angry with what he had promised us, versus
 what was showing on our account. She admitted that the first representative cut corners, completely
 mishandled our account, and flat out LIED to us.
 The representative ended up not touching anything on our account, because she stated that there
 wasn't really much she could do from there. We took our new boxes and dropped off our modem. She
 recommended that we plug in our equipment, and call customer service to figure it out from there.
 We did this, and weren't surprised when nothing worked.
 So we call the evening of Sunday, May 3rd. The rep on the phone says that our bill will be ~$145+tax,
 and there is nothing they can do to turn our service on. We would need a technician to come out. She
 tells us to call early Monday morning, and that we will be able to have someone come out that day.
 For some reasons unknown to us, she would not scheduled us an appointment though.
 We call very early Monday morning (May 4th), and the rep tells us that we can't have someone come
 out until Wednesday, May 6th at the earliest, and nothing before 5pm until the weekend.
 He claims that he tried to activate our internet, but that it's impossible to do remotely. Even though
 Comcast internet/TV was ON in that house 5 days prior with the previous tenants.
 Now we have to take another day off work just to get cable/internet turned on, we still have NO IDEA
 what our bill is going to be. We have been told that our service is a different price from EVERY single
 person that we've talked to.
 What frustrates me most, is that every time I call, the rep just says ""It's not my fault, this is the first
 time I've seen the issue"". Well OF COURSE it is, because your Comcast NEVER let's you talk to the
 same person twice. Everyone is hidden, so there is NO accountability. There are no names or direct
 phone numbers.
 So now we will have to take our 2nd day off from work this week, and I am not at all confident that
 there is an end in sight.
 I've heard horror stories of Comcast's customer service, but I never full experienced it until now",
Unfair billing practices of Comcast,2015-06-24,Boston,Massachusetts,2115,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 year my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 70 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

"RACIST CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM MANAGER SONIA AND EMPLOYEE ADRIANA COMCAST LOCATION ""999 Edgewater Blvd, Foster City, CA 94404""",2015-05-10,San Jose,California,95123,"went to comcast at 5pm
 asked for box, didn't respond
 then laughing
 I've had Comcast service since last September 2014 and on record, I have called at least almost
 once a week since then which would amount to at least 36 calls made all based on repeated lack of
 customer service. It was my mistake to think Comcast is superior to ATT, however I probably
 would've had an easier time if I had just gone with ATT. I've threatened to cancel my Comcast
 internet service time and time again. I solved the problem that comcast couldn't. Paying for high
 speed and not being able to load even ""WWW.GOOGLE.COM"" within even a few hours is insanity. I
 should not have to wait hours for a single web page to load every other week or so. Meanwhile,
 comcast freely takes your money and doesn't even compensate for the amount of time spent and
 paid for the service that was never ""actually"" offered. I have basically learned enough from the
 countless phone calls about broken service in disrepair that I could possibly become a Comcast
 technician. I've obtained more than enough training obtaining various bits of knowledge from the
 revolving door of mediocre service technicians that have been through my house. Had I known I
 would have to become a student and learn from Comcasts mistakes to fix my own, I would've
 immediately ran towards ATT. I've had at least 5 or 10 different routers and modems that have failed
 or just completely given up. Without my constant proactive approach to this problem dealing with the
 horror show that comcast likes us to call ""customer service"", I would've never fixed my internet
 problem that began within the first week of subscribing to comcast. Almost 250 days later and I am
 unhappy to say that I am the only reason my internet is now working like a normal internet should be,
 and for what I've already paid, I will never get back the money spent over the past 9 months where
 the majority of the time I either spent days upon days calling comcast customer service only to be
 disappointed immediately afterwards with service failures or to be hopeful that the next comcast
 technician would fix the problem, which they never did. Each technician knew bits and pieces of how
 to best make the internet work along with their different personalities. One of the technicians came
 over and almost wanted to leave right away without actually doing any work at all. Just yesterday I
 went to comcast in Foster City, CA (999 Edgewater Blvd, Foster City, CA 94404) and spoke with a
 woman named ""Adriana"" who didn't answer any of my questions despite asking twice initially. She
 failed to acknowledge that we are the customer, and she is the worker. She was basically ignoring me
 and my other friend who also subscribes to comcast and just doing whatever she thought made
 sense to her. I specifically asked for the dual band modem and she responded with ""what? i don't
 know what you're talking about?"" and passed it off as ignorantly as she could. How am I, the
 customer, supposed to respond to that? Do I have to guide the worker on what needs to be done? I
 had to come back a second time where even the manager was rude. I came back to the store almost
 15 minutes later and saw there was one woman employee named ""Adriana"", and her manager
 named ""Sonia"". Adriana was helping a customer. Sonia, the manager in charge, was processing
 other items possibly to finish up her work so she could go home since it was close to closing time.
 The manager yelled at me and said ""I am closed, she will help you"". I responded with ""You're
 employee gave me the wrong item when I came in not too long ago"". She said to wait for Adriana to
 finish up with the ""one and only single"" customer in there. Not to mention, I was also unfairly treated
 and ignored which resulted in ending up with the wrong cable modem box unit. The second time I
 came in, ""Adriana"" almost laughed at me because she couldn't understand why I was furious. The
 other thing that made it even worse and more infuriating was that another ""white"" gentleman walked
 in and the manager quickly got herself together and said ""Oh, I can help you in a minute"". How am I
 supposed to feel about this? This is basically racism. Comcast is a hopeless company to me and
 everyone I meet. I will continue to spread the word and possibly file a few more complaints. Why not?
 Comcast doesn't seem to mind handing out loads of ignorance and attitude so I guess will yell from
 now on every time I come in the store since that seems to be the only thing that might work. Even
 then, it may not. How crazy is this? I will be filing on various other websites and basically anywhere I
 can from now on. This story will not go unheard. Comcast owes me at LEAST over 6 months of solid
 free internet service for the way I've had to take things on so crazily, that I even know how a Comcast
 technician works and goes about his day. I the customer should not have to know these things so
 detailed however I don't even work for COMCAST!?!??! WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER!?!? NO
 THANK YOU!! I WOULD RATHER GO WITH ATT!!!! Comcast might've created a monopoly in San
 Jose, CA silicon valley, but I will not be made an example of. No sir. Not me.",
Billing Complaint,2015-06-24,Daly City,California,94015,"I called Comcast about my current billing and asked about when my current promotion would end and what the the new pricing would be. Two different Comcast representatives told me my bill would not go up until September 2015 and that I could decide if I wanted to pay the new pricing come September, change my plan or cancel.
 However, My bill due July 3rd 2015 jumped up to the new price, which was a jump of over $20+ and when I called there was nothing they could do because the Comcast rep said that the computer reverted to the new pricing because my promotion ended in June 2015.
 I was misled by Comcast because I was told by two different reps that I had until September 2015. Yet when I called about the price jump, the rep said there was nothing they could do and I think that this was false advertising and unfair business practices. How could the Comcast rep not do anything to help me and solve this issue. I feel that Comcast just STOLE money from me by misleading me about my bill. I hope the FCC can do something about Comcast and all cable/internet providers about their false advertising and unfair business practices that hurt consumers.

Difficulty with internet speeds,2015-04-28,Salt Lake City,Utah,84110,"Consumer has Comcast internet and phone; she tries to get better pricing for her plan but has an issue that the web-site won’t let her find a better deal. The site won’t allow her to change her password. She has talked to other providers and they offer her better rates. She has read articles that if she calls in to Comcast they’ll reduce her rate, but when she calls in they won’t reduce her rate. They won’t give her new customer rates. She called customer service to do a customer survey one day and they hung up on her 12 times. One time they held her to a contract she never read or signed.
 She was offered 50mbps but the rate then increased and her speed isn’t what they promised. They denied for months that it was a modem issue. Finally, in November 2014, they blamed her modem and sent her a new modem. As a resolution, the consumer wants a refund and the speed promised. ***CTR367-phone***

Loss of Electronics/Poor Customer Service/Faulty Grounding,2015-06-29,Lithonia,Georgia,30058,"Lightening struck outside my home next to a cable wire that was not properly grounded. I can actually see the orange cord as it was not originally buried deep enough. When lightening struck, the surge came through the cable line and burned out the following: Vizio TV, Denon Receiver, Sony Blu-ray player, comcast x1 box and modem. I called comcast regarding the outage on June 20th and received an appointment for June 26th. Not realizing that all of my services were out at the time of my original call, I had to make a subsequent call on June 21st and explain that ALL of my services were out: Internet, Phone and Cable. I was told that it would be ""escalated"" and someone would come to my home on June 22nd between 2:30 and 10:30pm. I was also told that I would receive a $90 credit for the time that my services were out. The representative ensured me that someone would be out the next day June 22nd between 2:30-10:30pm. Prior to leaving work for the day I called comcast to ensure someone was coming as I left work early to meet the service guys. As the evening progressed I called approximately 3 more times and was ensured all times that someone would show up and I would receive a call. Around 8pm I had not received a call and a service tech had not shown up at my home so I called comcast again and was told that ""dispatch"" closes at 7pm, by law they are not allowed to schedule anyone to service the inside of a customers home after 8pm, a service tech was not coming, ""escalation"" only means that if someone cancels then the person next in the ""escalation"" line gets the appointment. Therefore, I was told that due to the inconvenience I would receive an additional $20 credit and my case would still be ""escalated"". Needless to say I called several more and was told that more than likely I wouldn't see them until Friday, June 26th. A Vizio tech came out on Thursday, June 25th and had to replace the motherboard AND power board. On Friday, June 26th the guys showed up, replaced the ground cable (which is still exposed as the techs won't be out until July 11th to bury it. So if lightening strikes again....same issue!). They informed me that they can tell where the lightening struck which was next to an exposed cable line. They replaced the x1 box and modem and restored my services. However, upon starting up all my equipment (bluray and receiver) none of them worked. They power on none of them receive signals from the TV or cable box. I unplug both and plugged them up utilizing a new HDMI cable and to a different TV that works and nothing, both are burnt out due to comcast's inability to install products properly. I called and requested comcast replace the equipment that was burnt out. I was told that it was an ""act of God"" and therefore, not their fault. However, it was only after I said the ground wire was improperly installed that they initiated a claim ticket. Each time I called, I received nothing but the runaround and poor customer service. I was out of my services for a week, was promised credits that have not shown up on my account and services that are not complete. Now I have to return the faulty box upstairs to a service center in order to have cable upstairs. I have spoken to so many customer service representatives that promised a call from a supervisor (no call or message) and/or promised emergency service. I am very dissatisfied with the level of service or lack thereof I received and lack of resolution to an issue that was obviously not my fault. Additionally, I now have a bill in the amount of $159 (appx) because ""I am billed a month early and I won't see the credit until next month""
 however, when I called today the agent said she did see where a credit is to be issued. I have confirmation numbers for all conversations regarding credits and ""escalations"". Comcast is ripping off customers with their empty promises and lack of service!

Excessive early termination fees due immediately after 10+ years of service,2015-05-19,Stephens City,Virginia,22655,"Comcast, I recently moved to new location where comcast did offer service and Comcast hit me with
 two early termination fees of over $1000. They expected the early termination fees immediately.
 They immediately turned me over to collection agency a week after turning in equipment. I have
 received no less than four phone calls a day. I paid $500 last week and told comcast I would pay the
 rest next pay period which was in two weeks. The collection agency claimed I didnt turn in equipment
 which I spent hour on phone with comcast until they figured out that I did in fact turn all the equipment
 in to comcast office. Comcast would not offer a payment plan for the excessive termination fee
 charge. Excessive harrassment over unaware early termination fees with no payment plan offered.
 Told fees on 4/13 would be $600 then charged another termination fee over $500 more. Collection
 agency Southwest rude as all get out! No payment options offered just plain harrassment.

Comcast.,2015-04-16,Seattle,Washington,98178,"Agreed upon price: 49.99 (+ taxes, fees), charged 72.50. Not about the amount, but rather the fact I was told one thing and then charged another. I feel disrespected and in a sense, betrayed, even though I would not have put it past them to try this. I submitted a complaint to the FTC regarding this, as there was no notification of a change in pricing, nothing. Just one day it went from approximately $52.00 to $72.00. I paid for internet and public cable to keep the price low at $52.00. After reading how the open internet transparency mandate requires ISP's to disclose pricing details, I decided to bring you into the loop as well. At least if a price that is charged monthly without changing is to change, notify the customer. Send them a letter, email them, call them, exert effort. No effort was exerted and a line was crossed. It's not okay to say you will charge one thing and actually charge another.
 Random issue that popped up when I tried to get a hold of them was their website states that representatives are available 24/7. Which insinuates that a representative from each department is available, which is not true. Just technicians are available. Technicians as in technical support/representatives.

Non working service,2015-06-29,Rahway,New Jersey,7065,"I placed a disc order because we were moving to new loc. Against my better judgement, changed to move order. Install order slated for 1-3 on June 27th 2015. 4pm Comcast calls and states tech running late. 430 tech shows up leaves all equipment and states unable to activate... Goodbye. My wife calls in enraged the service is not working and questioning how a professional would just walk out with the job incomplete. Transferred to 4 different departments hung up on a finally she reaches someone who states they can help. 21 mins later advised sorry the dept which can help you is closed, they are closed tomorrow so have to wait til Monday. This is unacceptable! Why should MY family have to suffer because Comcast has unprofessional, uncaring and incompetent employees? However, this too shall pass. This is a temporary location and rest assured we will NEVER EVER use Comcast again! Good job! I guess eventually our service will be activated and you can again resume billing me your exorbitant rates for your subpar service...oh wait you are probably billing me now for my non working service.
 Update Mon 6/29/2015
 No one has contacted me, service still DOES NOT WORK. Contacted billing as per the previous reps direction...nope can not assist me. Then transferred to customer resolution dept, no idea what he is talking about or what is going on, advises me I need tech support and he would bring on the line with us. He proceeds to transfer me, 15 minutes..no answer. Thanks again Comcast for this fabulous service!
 It seems to me, no one knows why my service is not working and obviously no one cares. I have already made several complaints with the FCC and I will continue to do so until all my service is working.

Comcast complaint,2015-06-18,Cupertino,California,95014,"In April 2015 we saw a Comcast employee in a cherry-picker working on the telephone/internet lines behind our house (without notifying us). When he left, our Comcast internet was down. I called Comcast the same day, explained what had happened, and they said the earliest they could send someone to fix it was two days later. I was promised that we would receive a credit for the days we would be without service.
 When the Comcast technician came two days later, he explained that it appeared that the other employee had placed some kind of ""filter"" on our line, due to a ""leaking signal"" which he said would cause them to be fined by the FCC. He was able to climb up to the line and remove the filter, which immediately started our internet working again. He mentioned that the leak seemed to be on our neighbor's line, not ours, and could offer no explanation for why the filter was placed on our line nor why we were not notified of this in advance or at the time the filter was placed.
 Thereafter on our next bill, we were not credited for the days we had been without service as we had been promised, and in addition Comcast charged us an additional $70 for the ""service call."" I called Comcast and was promised that the $70 would be refunded and we would receive an additional credit of $20 for the days without service.
 On the next bill, we did receive the $20 credit but not the $70 ""service fee"" refund. Today, I called Comcast to inquire about the $70 refund and was told that in fact we would not receive the credit because the ""service fee"" was a valid charge. Comcast had no record of what had transpired during the technician's visit nor my previous conversations with their representatives in which I was promised to be refunded for the $70 charge. After escalating the dispute I was able to get them to agree to credit me for the $70. I have not seen this actually show up on my account yet, and until then am not confident that they will actually follow through since apparently they have no system to track the promises that are made to customers over the phone.
 My complaint is regarding the initial service problem we had, with Comcast basically shutting off our service without notifying us due to some vague ""leaking signal"" which was never fully explained to me. When the technician came out all he did was take the filter off and never said what would happen if the signal continued to ""leak,"" which apparently was bad enough that they had to shut off the signal in the first place. Then, I feel like we were basically held hostage by Comcast whereby they feel they can just come out and shut off our service arbitrarily, then charge us $70 to turn it back on! After arguing at length with their escalation department I was able to get them to agree to a one-time credit of the service fee but they were clear that any future calls would definitely be subject to the fee. They offered that I could subscribe to a ""protection plan"" for an additional monthly charge to presumably prevent this from happening, which appears completely unethical.

Comcast Internet Data Cap LIES,2015-06-30,Cartersville,Georgia,30121,"I live in an area where Comcast is our only option for high speed internet access. I am a graphic designer, and transfer large files over the internet for work. I spoke with Comcast in the last year, and asked what I could do to get my data limit raised, even if it costed me money. I was told that if I upgraded my internet speeds to the ""extreme 105"" plan, I would be given double the usual 300gb/month limit, 600gb/month. I agreed to this plan, and got the corresponding monthly charge increase. Comcast has since denied any knowledge of this conversation, and claims that it isn't possible for me to receive this data increase and I must be misunderstood about what the previous representative claimed. I know for a fact that I am not mistaken, because I made sure to confirm this claim with multiple representatives before I agreed to the monthly cost increase. Now, I am stuck with extremely fast internet access, but the same data cap I was willing to pay to avoid. I was lied to by multiple representatives of Comcast, but they know they are my only option and they do not care if I am unsatisfied with their service. they have a monopoly on high speed access in my area and they are abusing their power.

"Sold one service, received another",2015-06-11,Northport,Alabama,35473,"I was sold a 150mbps speed with no data allowance restrictions, no contract, and billed at $48.99 per month with a $50 deposit. I am only receiving 50mbps and being told that I only have a 50mbps service and that the 150mbps speed isn't available in my area. I was offered 105mbps speed with a price increase to $89.99. I was informed by the rep, Robert (1800-219-5520 ext 8377) and his supervisor Shirley that all of this info was accurate and that this call IS being recorded. I am offended at the run-around I have been given and the failure to accurately address this issue. I expect 150mbps or as close to it as possible for $48.99 as I was sold and agreed to. I also have charges on my account detailing an installation for 6/12/15 when I explicitly stated i would self install as I did. There are also charges for tv service install when all I ordered was internet. Other representatives are confused as to why I am being transferred there and have stated that the account was setup completely wrong.

Comcast: Billing issue,2015-04-27,Washington,District Of Columbia,20002,"This is a complaint about Comcast Cable and Internet company. I recently received notice from a billing collection agency stating I had unpaid charges. This came as a total surprise to me and after speaking with Comcast found out my charges were from 4-5 months ago from when I transferred my account to a roommate as a result of my relocation outside of the Philadelphia area. Essentially, I turned over the account to my roommate and was told by Comcast that there was nothing more to do, the balance was 0 and nothing additional would be in my name at this time (mid December). I made a point of asking this several times.
 Now, as a resident of Washington Dc, I received notice at an old address that I had an unpaid balance. Please note, that during this time I have once again become a Comcast customer. They did not notify me once via phone/email/account that I had these additional charges. After speaking with customer service, I was told the charges were from a time period after the account had been switched out of my name (a period in which I no longer lived at said address). After failed multiple attempts to gain justification of this charge I felt it necessary to register a complaint. At this point I am still waiting for Comcast to contact me. I refuse to contact them again as my last conversation they stated a manager would be in contact with me.

Comcast Blocking UDP Port 443,2015-06-05,Arlington,Virginia,22206,"I work for the federal government and am the CIO of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). We support a large telework contingent. Two days ago our VOIP access from home to TTB stopped working for our users that have Comcast as an ISP. It continues to work for all other users that have a different ISP. All other services over Comcast work (i.e. laptop VPN that uses TCP port 443). We have an in-house Internet test system that shows UDP Port 443 being blocked. We also see this on our Internal VOIP logs. My fundamental issue (other than it not working) is that there is no way for a TTB network engineer to work with Comcast to resolve this on behalf of our users. The only way to get support is to have each individual contact Comcast directly. Since the users have no technical network knowledge, they get the script reading support people and a session that ends with we (Comcast) changed nothing and the issue is yours. That ignores the simple fact that it has worked for years and years and continues to work for anyone that has a different ISP. Any help appreciated.
 I have the issue at my home (the account number provided) but am filing on behalf of my employees that are affected. I listed the name of one employee that worked with Comcast. The Comcast rep was good, but the problem is not resolved. Ref CR

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/9/2015 11:58:38 AM:
 I was contacted last evening by a host of Comcast personnel. We received excellent support and the problem is resolved. For the record - the UDP port 443 traffic was making it out of the Comcast network but was not making it to TTB. Another provider between Comcast and TTB implemented a security fix last week that caused the issue. Comcast worked directly with that provider and caused the issue to be fixed. We are appreciative of this level of support and Comcast has requested that I use the contacts provided in the event of a similar issue in the future. This addresses all issues in my complaint.
 Thank you to Comcast and thank you to the FCC for the support in resolving our issue."
